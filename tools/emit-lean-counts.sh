# emit-lean-counts.sh — keep the prose's law/axiom counts equal to the register's.
#
# The drift this closes is old and repeated: two documents said "29 laws" while the tree held 43; the
# register's own header said "all 43 laws" after 49 existed; `laws.md` carried both "49 laws, 58
# entries today" and, three paragraphs later, "48 laws and 57 entries"; `TYPE-SYSTEM.md` said "30
# element-comparator axioms" in three places two programmes after that number became 4. Every one of
# those was a *live* claim about a machine-emitted total, restated by hand, and nothing read them.
#
# So the totals are generated. A prose file marks the span it wants filled:
#
#     ... counts *entries* rather than laws (<!-- counts:laws -->49 laws<!-- counts:end -->, ...
#
# and this script rewrites every marked span from `spec/laws.tsv` (the register's own emission). Keys:
#
#     laws, entries, laws-entries, axioms, summary,
#     proved-laws, proved-tied-laws, proved-model-laws, owed-laws, open-laws,
#     orphaned-laws, vacuous-laws, axiom-by-design-laws
#
# `--check` (what the gate runs) rewrites into a scratch copy and refuses a diff, the same discipline
# `emit-lean-laws.sh` uses for `spec/laws.tsv` itself. It also fails on a **hand-written** register total
# in one of these files: a digit followed by `laws`/`entries`/`axioms` where the digit is one of the
# register's own totals (current or known-past) and the line carries no marker.
#
# The limit of that scan, stated rather than implied: it catches the class that actually rots — a writer
# copying a total out of the register — and not every possible count. "the 29 laws" *was* the name of a
# section (laws 1–29) while that section existed; the folder's pages are now one per layer with the whole
# set in `laws.md`, so 29 is on the stale list like the rest, and a page that wants to name a *range*
# uses an en dash (`30–43`), which the number step does not consume. "four (30, 31, 33, 36) are open" is
# spelled out and therefore outside it; and a sentence about history ("the tree grew to 43 laws while
# both said 29") is a record, not a claim, which is why the scan is scoped to the reader-facing documents
# and not to `spec/Rchain/`'s module docs, where those records live. A count a reader is meant to believe
# gets a marker.
