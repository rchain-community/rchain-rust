# devnet — a single Docker script for a local RChain network.
#
# Two modes, one script:
#   • devnet  (default) — bonded validators that produce blocks + a funded deployer wallet, for
#     developing/deploying rholang contracts and reading results back.
#   • network — a bare 1..5 node topology (no autopropose, no deployer) for exercising sync/gossip;
#     drive it manually with `cli <node> propose`.
#
# Prereqs: docker (a running daemon) and openssl.
#
# SECURITY: the validator/deployer keys below are throwaway keys for a LOCAL testnet only.
# Never reuse them for anything with real value.

# The container/volume prefix is overridable so a *second*, independent network can be brought up

# touching the running network's containers or volumes. `NETWORK` stays its own variable because the
# default name is what other tooling and the docs expect.

# Per-node memory ceiling, applied as `--memory` on every container this script starts. What it
# protects is the *host*: a devnet is usually one of several heavy jobs on a workstation, and an
# unconstrained node that goes wrong takes the machine with it. That is not hypothetical — on
# 2026-09-29 a three-validator devnet under a four-way deploy storm ran beside two other heavy jobs,
# the kernel logged `fill_page_cache_func hogged CPU for >10000us` and then `Under memory pressure,
# flushing caches.`, and the machine froze: 47 GiB of RAM against 2 GiB of swap, so there was no
# reclaim to fall back on. The unconstrained containers were the part of that this script could have
# prevented, and nothing here stopped them.
#
# **The ceiling does bind under load, and that is the designed trade.** Measured the same day, after
# this flag went in: with `4g`, two of three nodes were OOM-killed (exit 137, `oom=true`) *seventeen
# seconds* into the four-way storm, at height ~13. The image is ~132 MiB; a node mid-storm is not. The
# host stayed up with 37 GiB free, which is the outcome this flag is for. A measurement that needs a
# node to *survive* a storm must raise this (`DEVNET_NODE_MEMORY=8g`), lower the storm's concurrency,
# or count the OOM kill as one of its results — a node killed this way ends the run early and, from a
# sampler's side, is indistinguishable from one that merely stopped answering.
#
# `--memory-swap` is set *equal* to `--memory` deliberately: that turns swap off for the node, so a
# node that exceeds its ceiling is OOM-killed inside its own cgroup rather than pushing the host into
# the thrash that makes a freeze a freeze. A killed node costs one run; a thrashed host costs the
# session, and the evidence of what the run was doing.
#
# CPU is deliberately **not** capped. The block timing a devnet measurement observes is the thing
# under test (issue #105's storm is a latency phenomenon), so constraining the scheduler would change
# what is measured. Memory headroom does not. Set to the empty string to opt out of the memory cap.

# The bootstrap's data volume, when a measurement must run against an existing artifact rather than
# `${BOOTSTRAP}-data` (set by `up --data-volume`). Empty means the default.

# The volumes this checkout has carried, and what each is for (recorded 2026-09-24, so the next reader
# does not have to guess from `docker volume ls`):
#   devnet-stale-snapshot      the recorded long chain — *the artifact* measurements run against. It is
#                              a live chain: each run that mounts it extends it (5,844 blocks when it was
#                              recorded, 6,339 after the 2026-09-24 serving-term runs), so a measurement
#                              quoting a height must say which height it measured.
#   devnet-bootstrap-data      the standard bootstrap's own store; `up` reuses it and `--fresh` discards
#   devnet-validator-{1..7}-data  the standard validators' stores, same reuse/`--fresh` semantics
#   devnet-perf-boot           an earlier measurement's bootstrap store, kept for comparison
#   perfsync-validator-{1,2}-data  created by `DEVNET_PREFIX=perfsync` for the fresh-peer measurement;
#                              **disposable** — `DEVNET_PREFIX=perfsync tools/devnet.sh down -v` removes
#                              them and the network they ran on (~40 MiB total)

`up` options:

  --nodes N                      bare network topology: 1 bootstrap + N-1 peers (1..5),
                                 shorthand for --validators 1 --observers N-1 --no-autopropose
                                 --no-deployer --no-admin
  --autopropose | --no-autopropose
                                 continuously produce blocks on a timer (default: on for devnet,
                                 off for --nodes)
  --propose-on-deploy | --no-propose-on-deploy
                                 propose a block immediately after a deploy (default: on for devnet)
  --admin | --no-admin           publish the admin HTTP API (40405) to the host *and* opt the node's
                                 admin listener back in to binding it. AUDIT C112 binds that listener
                                 to loopback unless the operator asks, and without the opt-in the
                                 published port accepts nothing from the host — so before this, a
                                 published admin port was a port nothing could connect to
                                 (default: on for devnet)
  --fresh                        discard the nodes' data volumes first, so the bootstrap creates the
                                 genesis rather than rebuilding its stored chain (a *restart* rebuilds
                                 and replays the accumulated chain; `up` says which one it is doing)
  --data-volume NAME             mount an existing data volume as the *bootstrap's* data directory,
                                 for measuring against a recorded chain (must already exist; the
                                 validators still use their own `${name}-data` volumes)
  --effect-scheduler MODE        effect-scheduler mode: dfs (default), gate, relaxed-validated, or
                                 relaxed — the last is rejected on the block path at runtime, which
                                 is how tools/devnet-fuzz.py --mode scheduler exercises that guard
  --epoch-length N               PoS epoch length: the first epoch boundary is at block N (default
                                 10000, so a short devnet never reaches one). A *genesis* parameter,
                                 so every bonded validator is given the same value
  --stakes A,B[,C]               per-validator genesis bond, in validator order (default: 100
                                 each). Unequal stakes are how a measurement reaches the cases #70
                                 turns on: three equal validators minus one is *exactly* 2/3, which
                                 is not a supermajority (`two_thirds_is_not_supermajority`), while
                                 100/100/50 minus the 50 leaves 80 % and should recover.
  --active-validators N          the active-set draw's cap. Below the validator count the draw
                                 *selects*, which is the only way to watch randomised selection do
                                 anything on a live chain (default 100, i.e. no selection at 1-3)
  --deployer-key HEX | --no-deployer
                                 fund the deployer wallet + enable dev-mode dummy-deploy keepalive
                                 (default: on for devnet, using validator[0]'s key)

When are blocks created?
  A block is created only when one of these fires: (a) --propose-on-deploy and a deploy is accepted;
  (b) --autopropose's timer/dummy-deploy; or (c) an explicit `propose`/`POST /api/v1/propose`. An idle
  node with none of these produces no blocks.
