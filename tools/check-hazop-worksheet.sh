# check-hazop-worksheet — the failure-mode worksheet's completeness claim, checked against the page.
#
# Why this exists. `docs/src/spec/failure-hazop.md` is a companion to the acceptance worksheet
# (`docs/src/spec/testnet-acceptance.md` section 1), whose rows carry the hazards and the root-cause
# analysis. That worksheet is prose: a cell can be empty, a guide word can be neither rowed nor folded
# nor vacuously dismissed, and nothing refuses it. The rule this repository keeps relearning is that
# **prose is not a check** — a page that claims "every (node x guide word) cell is dispositioned" is
# making a claim about a document, and a claim about a document belongs in a check that reads it.
#
# The format contract, and why the page must be machine-shaped:
#
#   ### U<n> — <name>
#   **Design intent.** <one sentence>
#   **Guide words.** row: NO, MORE, ... · folded: LATE -> NO, ... · vacuous: REVERSE (a reason) · owed: EARLY, AFTER
#   | ID | Guide word | Deviation | RCA | Current behaviour | Class | Disposition | Falsifier |
#   | **F-U1-01** | NO | ... | ... | ... | Historic | R2 | casper/src/x.rs::a_named_test |
#
# Checks:
#   1  every node dispositions all eleven guide words exactly once (row / folded / vacuous / owed)
#   2  every word declared a `row` carries at least one Table A row, and no Table A row carries a word
#      the node did not declare as a row (a row for a folded or vacuous word is invisible debt)
#   3  every Table A row states a definite rung R1..R4 and a falsifier that is either an `owed:`
#      marker or a path **and symbol** that exist in this tree (`path::test_name` — the file must exist
#      *and* the name must occur in it, because a fabricated test name is the defect class this
#      repository has paid for most often)
#   4  the page declares its own debt and the declaration matches the count:
#      `**Debt.** falsifiers owed: N · node-words owed: M`
#   5  the scan is not vacuous: at least one node and at least one Table A row were found
#
# A word under `owed:` is debt made visible and countable, never a silent omission — it is a cell this
# pass did not reach, and check 4 is what stops the count from rotting. Disposition, likewise, must be
# a decided rung: the point of the exercise is that an auditor picks one, and a sheet that offers
# "R1/R2" has not done the work it exists to do.
#
# Usage: tools/check-hazop-worksheet.sh [--gate] [<worksheet>]
#        --gate exits non-zero on a violation (for CI). Without it the report is printed, the
#        violations still name themselves, and the exit is 0 so a reader can run it mid-edit.
#        The default worksheet is docs/src/spec/failure-hazop.md.
