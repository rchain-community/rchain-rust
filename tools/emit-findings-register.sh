# Render the audit check-off into `spec/AUDIT.md` from `spec/findings.tsv` and the review ledger.
#
# **Why this exists, in one measurement.** `spec/AUDIT.md` was 4,366 lines organised by audit *pass*,
# and a finding's state was a bolded phrase at an arbitrary position inside a 2 KB cell -- `**Fixed`
# 108 times, `**Decided` 9, `**Registered` 4, and a different vocabulary on top in each pass section.
# So "what is left?" took twenty-one sections and a hand merge, nothing could answer it, and the answer
# nobody could see was that six of §13's Low findings had sat unaddressed since pass 4.
#
# Three states now, in the order a person works: `todo`, `in progress`, `done`. The state is authored
# in the TSV; this renders it; `--check` refuses a check-off that disagrees.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/emit-findings-register.sh            # write the check-off into spec/AUDIT.md
#   tools/emit-findings-register.sh --check    # exit 1 if the committed check-off is stale
#
# Exit: 0 ok · 1 stale or malformed · 2 usage.

# **A finding that names no law is a defect of the register rather than of the code.** Four findings of

# nothing could tell an instance of a known property from a novelty; the column is that tell. It is
# validated in both directions -- a name that resolves to nothing is refused, the `evidence` check's
# lesson -- and the residue is a **number printed on every run** rather than silence, which is how the
# T1 coverage half already turns its own gap into a count.
#
# **The ceiling is a ratchet.** It may be lowered as rows are classified and may not be raised: a change
# that adds rows naming no law is exactly what it exists to make visible, and the open rows (a `todo`)
# must name one, because an open finding without a law cannot be classified at all.

# --- every `evidence` token names something that exists ------------------------------------------
#
# **This is the check that makes `done` mean anything.** An `evidence` cell claims the tree contains
# what holds the fix; a token resolving to nothing is a citation to a test that was renamed, deleted,
# or never written -- the class pass 9 found three of (C152, C153, C154). One pass over the tracked
# tree, ~1.5 s, 22,878 identifiers. `legacy/` and the generated `docs/book/` are excluded: a name that
# only exists in the unported Scala is not evidence that the port holds the fix.
#
# **Three ways this check was a tautology, all three repaired together**, because fixing any one alone
# still passes on a cell that resolves to nothing:
#
#   1. **It indexed its own source of truth.** The tokens are read *out of* `spec/findings.tsv`, so
#      including that file here made every token resolve against its own cell. `spec/AUDIT.md` is the
#      rendered form of the same cells. Both are excluded.
#   2. **It read the working tree, not the commit.** `git ls-files | xargs grep` greps the *files on
#      disk*, so a test that has never been committed resolves — which is how C182's guard came to be
#      cited while it lived only in an uncommitted edit. `git grep HEAD` reads the committed blobs.
#   3. **Any mention satisfied it.** The subject is "does this identifier occur anywhere in the tree",
#      and a *prose mention* is an occurrence. The first draft of this very comment contained the
#      underscored form of a filename and so kept its row green — which is the check failing on the case
#      it exists for, demonstrated by the person fixing it. Hence no identifier in this comment.
#
# What the check now means, honestly: *the named identifier exists in the committed tree somewhere* —
# not that it names the right thing, not that it is a definition, and not that the file still exists
# under that name. It catches a renamed or deleted symbol; it does not catch a wrong reference.
