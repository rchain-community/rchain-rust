# AGENTS.md — RChain → Rust rewrite: intent & formal specification

This file is the **authoritative intent + formal specification** for rewriting this node in Rust. It
is written for both AI coding agents and humans: read it in full before writing or changing any Rust
code, and treat its statements as binding constraints, not suggestions.

## Documentation map

Single sources of truth (do not duplicate these). The curated book is `docs/src/` (built with
`mdbook build docs`); the **software** documentation is Parts I–III, the **port** documentation is Part
IV.

### Learning rholang (AI navigation)

For an agent that needs to *understand the language* (rather than port code), the shortest path is:

1. [`docs/src/rholang/why-rholang.md`](docs/src/rholang/why-rholang.md) → the model and why it fits a
   blockchain.
2. [`docs/src/rholang/processes-names.md`](docs/src/rholang/processes-names.md) →
   [`docs/src/rholang/unforgeable-names.md`](docs/src/rholang/unforgeable-names.md) → the core
   constructs.
3. [`docs/src/formal/grammar-sorts.md`](docs/src/formal/grammar-sorts.md) +
   [`docs/src/formal/the-19-laws.md`](docs/src/formal/the-19-laws.md) → the precise semantics.
4. [`docs/src/ai-entrypoint.md`](docs/src/ai-entrypoint.md) → any other goal (consensus, capabilities,
   the port).

The formal oracle is `spec/`; the book explains it, it does not duplicate it.

## Intent

The RChain node runs Rholang natively. We are rewriting it in **Rust**, absorbing both the Scala/JVM
code and the C++ Rosette VM. The motivation — memory safety and the calculus-native expression of the
node (λ → π → ρ → Calculus of Constructions) — is laid out in
[`docs/src/contributor/why-rust.md`](docs/src/contributor/why-rust.md).

**Prime directive:** the Scala/JVM + Rosette *port* is complete; the node is now a **faithful
implementation of the ρ-calculus**. The oracle is the mathematical specification — the 22 laws in
[`spec/INVENTORY.md`](spec/INVENTORY.md) and the ρ→CoC type discipline in
[`spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md`](spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md) — **not** the Scala code. Implement each law using Rust's
strengths: carry the invariants *structurally* in the type system (refinement types, no silent
partiality), rather than mechanically reproducing Scala's patterns. Where the Scala code and the
specification disagree, the specification is correct and the code is brought into line — a latent
Scala bug (e.g. wrapping a negative cost into a `uint64`) is **not** preserved; such deviations are
recorded in [`spec/AUDIT.md`](spec/AUDIT.md)'s Scala-deviation register.

## How to use this file

For any component you are about to write in Rust:

1. Find its layer below and its law numbers in [`spec/INVENTORY.md`](spec/INVENTORY.md).
2. Read the corresponding formalization (Lean 4 and/or Coq) and the law's invariant statement; the
   Scala/C++ file is reference material for the ported behavior, not the oracle.
3. Read the ground-truth Scala test that already encodes the law.
4. Write Rust that satisfies the law, gated by a property test and a differential test (see
   *Translation contract*).

## The formal specifications

| Track | Scope | Location | Build |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Lean 4** (primary) | algebraic/order laws, canonicalization, merge monoids, consensus arithmetic | [`spec/`](spec/) | `cd spec && lake build` |
| **Coq** | substitution, α-equivalence, and programming-language metatheory (Autosubst in Phase 1) | [`spec/coq/`](spec/coq/) | `make -C spec/coq` |
| **Inventory** | the 22 laws, each with source-of-truth + formalization status | [`spec/INVENTORY.md`](spec/INVENTORY.md) | — |
| **Type system** | the port's own type discipline: ρ-calculus as the base sort of a Calculus of Constructions, no silent partiality | [`spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md`](spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md), `Rchain/Rho.lean`, `Rchain/Ty.lean` | `cd spec && lake build` |

The **type-system spec** ([`spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md`](spec/TYPE-SYSTEM.md)) overlaps the Lean/Coq split
deliberately: Lean 4 proves the six fundamentals over the flat `Par` (sort classification, `≡`,
minimal substitution, minimal COMM reduction, canonicalization, totality); Coq keeps the deep
Autosubst α-equivalence reconciliation. It is a hardening of the port, not a new law.

The Lean 4 and Coq tracks are deliberately parallel: both define the same core `Proc` syntax and the
same canonicalization (`sort`) as Phase 0, and both state Law 1 (`sort` is idempotent and `par`
commutative) as a Phase 1 proof obligation. Coq is the home of the substitution metatheory (capture-
avoiding de Bruijn substitution, α-equivalence); Lean 4 is the home of the algebraic/order laws.

## Formal proof plan — rspace, rholang & Rosette

The two Meredith-designed cores — the **rholang executor** (`rholang/`, the ρ-calculus interpreter)
and **RSpace** (`rspace/`, the concurrent tuple space) — get the deepest machine-checked treatment, in
both **Coq** and **Lean 4**, *before* their Rust is written (**proofs-first**). The **Rosette VM**
(`rosette/`, `roscala/`) is also **in scope for the formalization** (Laws 12–13: actor atomicity,
reflection), formalized in a later phase. Note this is independent of the *rewrite*, where
`rosette`/`roscala` are deferred (orphaned). The split is by
strength:

| Tool | Laws | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| **Coq** (Autosubst, de Bruijn) | 2–6 | ρ-calculus PL metatheory: α-equivalence, structural congruence `≡`, capture-avoiding substitution, reduction (comm), spatial matching, free variables |
| **Lean 4** (Mathlib) | 1, 7–11 | order/algebra: canonicalization (`sort`), RSpace join commutativity, deterministic COMM, merge monoid, Merkle determinism, replay determinism |

**Proofs-first policy** (historical): the original plan paused the rewrite until Laws 1–11 were
proven. The rewrite is now complete (see Status); the formalization continues in parallel as the
residual proof track, and the specification remains the oracle for any subsequent change to the Rust
code.

### Phase sequence

- **P0** — full ADT in both tools; add Mathlib (Lean) and Autosubst (Coq); pin Meredith citations.
- **P1** — Law 1 (canonicalization) in both tools — the shared linchpin.
- **P2** — Coq: α-equivalence + substitution (Laws 2–3).
- **P3** — Coq: reduction + matching + free variables (Laws 4–6).
- **P4** — Lean: RSpace (Laws 7–11).
- **P5** — reconcile, update status, resume the rewrite.

### Meredith lineage (foundational references)

- Meredith & Radestock, *A Reflective Higher-Order Calculus* (2005) — the ρ-calculus.
- Meredith, *Higher Category Models of the π-Calculus* — the categorical semantics.
- The RChain architecture / RSpace model.
- In-repo executable semantics: `rholang/src/main/k/rholang/*.k` (`name-equivalence.k`,
  `processes-semantics.k`, `sending-receiving.k`, `matching-function.k`, `free.k`).

Per-law proof status lives in [`spec/INVENTORY.md`](spec/INVENTORY.md).

## What must be preserved

The full 22-law table (with per-law formalization status and line-level source pointers) lives in
[`spec/INVENTORY.md`](spec/INVENTORY.md); it is the canonical catalog and is not repeated here.

**Proven vs. axiomatized:** the algebraic/combinatorial laws are provable statements — Law 1
(idempotence/commutativity), Law 2's core (≡), Law 4's core (COMM), and Law 6 (`Closed`) are already
**proven** in `Rchain/`; the rest are **stated** (precise signature, definition deferred); Laws 12–13
(Rosette VM) are **orphaned** (out of scope — the Rust reducer replaces the VM). Cryptographic
primitives (Blake2b, secp256k1, Curve25519 — Law 19) are **axiomatized** — modeled as abstract
interfaces whose required properties are postulated, not proven. Liveness (eventual finality) is an
open question, not an inductive invariant.

## Layer map

- **Rholang** (`rholang/`, `models/`) — the ρ-calculus interpreter (canonical order, substitution,
  reduction, spatial matching).
- **RSpace** (`rspace/`) — the concurrent tuple space (join commutativity, deterministic COMM, merge
  monoid, Merkle radix trie, replay).
- **Rosette** (`rosette/`, `roscala/`) — the C++ actor VM (actor atomicity, reflection, fork-join).
- **Casper** (`casper/`, `block-storage/`, `sdk/`) — CBC-Casper consensus + DAG (>2/3 finality,
  fringe/estimator, block validation, merge determinism).
- **Crypto** (`crypto/`) — Blake2b256, `Blake2b512Random`, secp256k1, Curve25519.

Per-layer Scala source-of-truth files are listed in
[`docs/src/contributor/architecture.md`](docs/src/contributor/architecture.md).

## Translation contract (spec → Rust)

For every law in the inventory:

1. **Property test** — a `proptest`/`quickcheck` property asserting the law on the Rust
   implementation (e.g. `sort(sort(p)) == sort(p)`, merge is associative/commutative).
2. **Differential test** — feed identical inputs to the Scala node and the Rust node and compare
   state hashes / results; they must match exactly.
3. **Type-level fidelity** — the Lean/Coq types are the reference for the Rust data model and its
   `Ord`/`Hash`/`Eq` derivations. In particular `sort` becomes the `Ord` implementation that makes
   `Par` an order-insensitive (canonical) container.
4. **Axiomatized crypto** maps to Rust traits whose implementations are the *only* places the
   primitive may differ in behavior, and are pinned by known-answer test vectors.

## Ground truth

The oracle is the invariant catalog + the machine-checked formalization. The Scala tests below encode
the laws and remain **differential reference vectors** — the Rust implementation must agree with them
on every law, since they pin the ρ-calculus behavior:

- `rholang/src/test/scala/coop/rchain/rholang/interpreter/{ReduceSpec,ReplaySpec}.scala`
- `models/src/test/scala/coop/rchain/models/rholang/SortTest.scala`
- `node/src/test/scala/coop/rchain/node/mergeablity/MergeabilityRules.scala`
- `casper/src/test/scala/coop/rchain/casper/batch1/MultiParentCasperReportingSpec.scala`

A divergence from the *specification* is fixed in the Rust code and recorded in
[`spec/AUDIT.md`](spec/AUDIT.md); it is **not** propagated to stay byte-identical with a Scala bug.

## Module scoping & rewrite order

The rewrite order is dependency-driven and easiest-first; it deliberately differs from the
*formalization* phases above (which rank by invariant value). Both run in parallel: laws are proven
in phase order while code is ported in dependency order. The per-module LOC/difficulty/person-day
ratings, the full bottom-up order, and the workspace layout live in
[`docs/src/contributor/architecture.md`](docs/src/contributor/architecture.md).

Bottom-up order: `sdk` → `shared` → `crypto` + `graphz` → `models` →
`block-storage` + `rspace` + `comm` → `rholang` → `casper` → `node` → `rspace-bench`. **Defer**
`roscala`/`rosette`.

### Findings

- **`rosette`/`roscala` are orphaned** (absent from `build.sbt`, imported by nothing) — deferred.
- **Hoist `Blake2b256Hash`** out of `rspace` into `crypto`/`shared` so `models` stops depending on
  `rspace` (`models/.../ByteStringSyntax.scala`, `FringeData.scala`, `BlockMetadata.scala`).

## Running the node

Build and run the `rnode` binary (Rust pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`):

```sh
cargo build --release -p rchain-node --bin rnode
rnode run -s \
  --validator-private-key 67e56582298859ddae725f972992a07c6c4fb9f62a8fff58ce3ca926a1063530 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --api-host 127.0.0.1 --no-upnp
```

Standalone (`run -s`) is the **genesis master**: it needs a secp256k1 `--validator-private-key`
(32-byte base16; the PEM-path flag is parsed but not wired into the runtime) and a
`~/.rnode/genesis/wallets.txt` (must exist; may be empty — `bonds.txt` auto-generates). The API host
must be a literal IP (`SocketAddr::from_str` rejects hostnames like `localhost`). Deploy serves on
**40401**; Propose/Repl on loopback **40402**. Full instructions:
[`docs/src/node/operating.md`](docs/src/node/operating.md).

## Open questions

1. `casper/src/main/resources/casper.tla` models only the genesis **bootstrap ceremony**, not the
   finality rule — the formal finality spec must be reconstructed from `Finalizer.scala` and
   `MessageMapSyntax.scala`.
2. The `faultTolerance` field asserted in `integration-tests/test/test_dag_correctness.py` is not
   computed anywhere in this tree — its formula must be recovered or declared an open question.
3. **Rosette scope** — two independent decisions: (a) **formalization**: the Rosette VM is **in
   scope** (Laws 12–13, actor atomicity + reflection, a later proof phase); (b) **rewrite**:
   `rosette`/`roscala` are **deferred** — orphaned (absent from `build.sbt`, imported by nothing).

## Status

- **Phase 0 — complete**: Lean 4 skeleton (`spec/`), Coq skeleton (`spec/coq/`), the 22-law
  inventory, and this document.
- **Channel scheduler (Laws 20–22) — implemented**: the per-channel claim queue (`rspace/src/
  concurrent/channel_queue.rs`), the DFS gate and relaxed effect modes (`rholang/src/scheduler.rs`
  + `rholang/src/reduce.rs`), the scheduled produce phase-one/two split
  (`rspace/src/scheduled_space.rs`), the `--effect-scheduler {dfs,gate,relaxed}` node flag, and the
  casper block-path hard-reject for `relaxed` (off-chain only — explore-deploy is its outlet). The
  Lean formalization (`spec/Rchain/Scheduler.lean`: `queue_commit_path_ordered`,
  `gate_exec_refines_apply`, `next_step_closure_computable`, `one_hop_depth2_diverges`) was
  committed in the Phase 0 spec work; the reader-facing spec is
  [`docs/src/formal/channel-scheduler.md`](docs/src/formal/channel-scheduler.md).
- **Rewrite — complete**: all eleven crates (`sdk`, `shared`, `crypto`, `graphz`, `models`,
  `block-storage`, `rspace`, `rholang`, `casper`, `comm`, `node`) are ported at the
  workspace root. The proofs-first *pause* was lifted in practice; the port was written against the
  verified spec rather than waiting on Laws 1–11.
- **Node — operational**: `rnode` builds and runs. A standalone node reaches the `Running` state
  (genesis block created) and serves the API — Deploy **40401**, Propose/Repl **40402** (loopback),
  HTTP **40403**, admin **40405**, protocol **40400**, discovery **40404**. Run instructions:
  [`docs/src/node/operating.md`](docs/src/node/operating.md).
- **Formalization — residual**: Law 1's idempotence/commutativity is proven, conditional on the 30
  element-comparator `axiom`s in `Rchain/Sort.lean` (the remaining "total order" obligation). Law 2's
  core (≡) and Law 4's core (COMM) are proven in `Rchain/Rho.lean`, Law 6 is proven in `Rchain/Ty.lean`;
  the rest are stated (see `spec/INVENTORY.md`), Laws 12–13 are orphaned (Rosette VM out of scope). The
  type-system fundamentals F1–F6 are proven in `Rchain/Ty.lean`. The adversarial audit findings are in
  `spec/AUDIT.md`.
