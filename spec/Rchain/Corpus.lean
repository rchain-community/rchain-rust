# The conformance corpus, generated from the specification

`lake exe rchain-corpus --layer flags --out …` prints the corpus the Rust is checked against, 1:1.
Each case carries its own source text and the *pattern the model believes that text denotes*: the
verdict is the model's (`decide`d here, so `lake build` fails if the model and the case disagree), and
the Rust consumer parses the same source and computes its own verdict, so a source that drifted from the
model fails the check instead of being trusted. Two independent parties, one source of truth each.

Law 35 (concreteness soundness) is the first layer, because the silent defects of AUDIT C9-C22 all pass
through one predicate: `spatial_match`'s first line consults `pattern.connective_used` and short-circuits
to structural equality when it is false. So a collection pattern whose only non-concreteness is a
`..._`/`...rest` remainder either matches partially or never matches at all, depending on a flag set far
away in the normalizer — which is exactly C22 item 3, and C19/C20's root cause.

/-! ## Law 37 — the matching layer

Each case is a *pattern* (as a receive bind spells it — `@` for a collection, since a collection is
not a name) and a *target*, both as rholang source, plus the verdict `spatialMatch` gives them. The
Rust consumer runs `target` into a channel, receives with `pattern`, and must get the same verdict.
The two shapes the ten incidents lived in are here: a partial map with a ground entry (C19/C20) and a
partial map whose only non-concreteness is the remainder (C22 item 3), each with the shape that must
*not* match beside it. -/

/-- The number of cases the matching layer carries. -/
def matchCaseCount : Nat := 22

/-- One matching case: the bind's source, the target's source, the model's view of both, and the
verdict. The verdict is `decide`d against `spatialMatch` (`matchCases_decide`), which is what makes
this corpus a law's corpus rather than a table of opinions. -/

  twice is refused by the normalizer (loudly, `UnexpectedReuseOfProcContextFree`) before any match
  happens, so its honest verdict is neither `true` nor `false`. The Rust consumer asserts the refusal
  for these rows — that is law 5 in the port, where the Scala's `addedVars.distinct` runs. -/

/-! ## Laws 38 and 40 — the silence layer

Each case is a *term* — a send and a receive on a channel, the receive's body reporting on `@"out"` —
and the verdict `takesStep` gives it: does the pair form a contract step at all? A term that does not
step produces nothing but the consumer's control datum, which is what "silent" means in the port, and
what the rule in `Rchain/Silence.lean` says: the contract rule carries the match as a hypothesis.

The last six cases are **law 40's** (*protocol agreement*: every call has an accepting receive at the
target's arity), and they are here rather than in a layer of their own because the verdict they need is
this one: a call whose arity matches no receive *is* a silent step, so `takesStep` is the same oracle
and a second consumer would be a copy of this one. What law 40 changed is the *rule* — `stepsInBinds`
now requires as many patterns as data, where it used to fail closed on anything but a single datum —
and those cases are what pins the change. -/

where `extraSlots` called the directory's `write(@key, @value, ret)` with two arguments and none of the

/-! ## Law 41 — the store layer

Each case is a *term* whose store is read **twice** — a `contract` reader called two times, which is
what makes it replicable — and the number of answers that must come back: `2` when the reader restores
what it consumed, `1` when it has consumed the store for good. The model's side of the case is the same
question asked of `Rchain/Store.lean`: `storeSurvives` after one read. The two sides are deliberately
different shapes — the term has the surface syntax and two calls; the model has the flat `Par` and the
replication — and they have to agree on the verdict, which is the corpus's premise.

Case 2 is the defect that started this (AUDIT C22 item 1: `Inbox.rho`'s zero-argument `read`), case 3 is
its repair (`box!(Nil)`: the read is documented to remove the *messages*, not the container), case 4 is
the shape C22 item 3 taught from the matching side — a restore that lives in only one branch of a
`match` is not a restore, and the term makes the datum take the other branch so the model's conservative
verdict and the node's behaviour are the same claim — and case 5 is the restore that goes to the wrong
channel, which is what makes the model compare channels rather than ask whether *any* send is there.

A *peek* is deliberately absent, for the reason the Directory's reads were never this law's defect:
`for (map <<- mapCh)` consumes nothing, so it cannot consume the store. The model's `Receive` has a
*persistent* flag and no peek one, so a peek case would have to state its own verdict rather than derive
it.

Every term declares the reader's name in the `new` (`new box, read in …`), because a name that is
*not* bound may be used only **once**: the second use of a free name is `UnexpectedReuseOfNameContextFree`
— the Scala's `NameNormalizeMatcher.scala:52` and the port's `normalizer.rs:111`, faithfully the same
rule. A `contract`'s own name is not bound by its definition, so a reader called twice must have its
channel in scope. -/

/-! ## Law 34 — the value-position rule (AUDIT C21)

`normalizeAt` threads the **accumulator** now (2026-09-24, G6), so "a value position is normalized
against an empty `par`" is a statement about a definition that could get it wrong: the ambient C21 leaked
into the condition *exists* in the model, and this layer is what refuses it. Each case is a term whose
`if` is *not* first in its `par` — so the `if` receives a non-empty ambient, which is the shape the defect
needed — plus that `if`'s condition, and each party normalizes the two source strings itself. A model
whose `ifThen` passed its ambient into the condition fails `c21Holds` on case 1, which is the falsifier
this layer now is rather than the tie it was: before the accumulator existed the defect was
*unrepresentable* here, and the row said so.

- The **model's** half is `decide`d here: the `Match` an `if` desugars into has the condition's
  normalization as its target, *and* the term's normalization is not the condition — the non-degeneracy
  half, so a case that accidentally was its own condition fails instead of passing quietly.
- The **node's** half is `rholang/tests/lean_c21_corpus.rs`: it parses both strings, normalizes them, and
  asserts the same relation.

The two sides never compare representations across the boundary — each compares terms it normalized
itself — so what ties them is the source text, as in every layer. Under the C21 defect the node's target
was `@"c"!(["a"]) | (1 == 1)` rather than `(1 == 1)`, which fails the node's half of every case here
while the model's half stays true: the corpus is built so that the *tie* is what breaks, and the
regression that motivated it (`normalizer.rs`'s `normalize_if` seeding the condition with `input.par`)
fails case 1 immediately.

Case 3 is the explicit `match` control — the desugaring that was never broken, which is the evidence that
this was `normalize_if`'s bug and not the rule's absence. Case 5's condition is a ground rather than an
expression, so the layer does not depend on the arithmetic clauses agreeing. -/

rendering of the declared `JE`, so a case that drifted fails `lake build`; the Rust consumer runs the
same source through the node's own codec and compares the JSON, so a case that disagrees with the node
fails the corpus. The cases cover the envelope's three counts (one → unwrapped, none → absent, two or
more → `ExprPar`) and every `JE` arm except the unforgeable leaf, which the model cannot decode back

to, what its sample must observe, and the sample itself — so the Rust consumer runs the sample and
reports; nothing about the meaning is the consumer's to decide. -/

/-! ## Laws 30 and 31 — the parse layer

The tables are the law (`Rchain/Parse.lean`: `grammarFragment`, `derives`, `parseDeviations`, and
`parseCases` with `parseCases_decide` checking every verdict); this layer renders them. Each row is a
source and what the node must do with it — `accept` or `reject` — so the Rust consumer
(`rholang/tests/lean_parse_corpus.rs`) runs the node's parser on that source and reports; nothing
about the verdict is the consumer's to decide.

The source is **rendered from the case's tokens** (`renderTokens`), not written beside them, so a row
cannot carry a spelling its verdict was not decided from — the drift is impossible by construction
rather than checked. -/

/-- One parse corpus line: layer, the source the tokens spell, the verdict the node must give, and
which half of the layer the row belongs to (`derivable` / `refused` / `deviation` / `printer`) — the
consumer pins a count for each half, so a list that silently shrank is caught where it shrank. -/

  "parse\t" ++ renderTokens c.tokens ++ "\t" ++ (if c.expect then "accept" else "reject")
    ++ "\t" ++ c.kind.tag

/-! ## Law 1 — the canonical order, pairwise (the `sort` layer)

Every state hash in the system is `sortPar`'s output, and until this layer existed **nothing tied that
order to the node**: law 1a was `proved-model` over a model a human keeps in sync, and law 1b's
comparator laws are `owed` (the twelve axioms in `Rchain/Sort.lean`).

**The first design for this layer was vacuous, and finding that out is part of its content.** A corpus of
"the sorted spelling of this par" cannot tie a comparator at all: the AST's fields are *canonical* values
(`Sorted<Par>`), so both the node's sorted output and the expected spelling get re-sorted by the *same*
comparator before anything is compared — any total order satisfies `sortPar src = parse sorted`. That is
what canonicalization *means*: it is the quotient by the comparator, and a quotient cannot distinguish
two comparators that induce the same equality. The tie has to be **pairwise**, on structures small
enough that canonicalization is the identity — which is what this layer is: each case is a *pair* of
terms and the verdict the model's `cmpPar` gives them, so the node's `Ord` on the same pair is compared
against the model's answer, with nothing in between to hide a disagreement.

The cases pin the arms a port can get wrong *silently* — the leaf arms, the **ground constructor order**
(`bool < int < str`), the **collection constructor order** (`elist < etuple < eset`), list arity, an
arithmetic node's operand order, and the send channel arm — and the layer's own non-degeneracy check
requires **all three verdicts** to appear, so a table that answered `lt` everywhere could not pass.

Cases 13–19 are the drift this layer was built to find, now closed. The model ordered by
*declaration* order; the node orders by its **score tree** (`models/src/sorter.rs`'s `node_score(tag,
children)`), and the first run of this corpus showed the two disagree on four separate structures — a
send's field order, the par's own field order, the expression-class order and `Ground.bool`'s
polarity. `Rchain/Sort.lean`'s comparators were reordered to the tags and these rows are the
falsifiers: restore the declaration order and the rows stop `decide`ing. The verdicts are the node's
own answers, read off `sort_pars` by the Rust consumer's diagnostic *before* the model was changed, so
the model was aligned to the node rather than to a guess. What could **not** be aligned is recorded in
`Sort.lean`'s note (the model's algebra is coarser: 24 `Expr` constructors against the node's 33 — rows
20–22 closed three of the gap's eight, and rows 23–25 pin those three constructors' *placement*, which
no earlier row could see). -/

/-! ## Law 16c — the `body` layer (AUDIT C57's option (b))

**What it ties.** The port has no `BodyProto`: a block is one `BlockMessageProto` with tags 1–17, and
`hash_block` clears exactly `blockHash` and `sig` and encodes the rest with `prost`. The model's
`encodeBody` narrows that to six fields, and this layer holds the model's `prost`-mirroring encoder
(`Rchain.Casper.Validate`'s `encodeProstBody`) and the node's `prost` to the **same bytes** — the two
rules a hand-written encoder gets wrong being **field order** (the model writes 4, 6, 5, 17, 9, 14;
`prost` writes ascending) and **default-skipping** (`prost` omits a field equal to its default; the
model writes unconditionally).

**The rows carry the node's bytes, observed first.** `node/tests/lean_body_corpus.rs`'s
`the_bytes_the_node_produces` printed `prost`'s encoding of these cases before any row was written; the
`bytesHex` below is that output, and `bodyCases_decide` then checks that the model's encoder reproduces
it. So the expectation is the node's answer, not the model's — the difference between this layer and a
corpus that only agrees with itself, and the reason the falsifier for it is a *Rust* mutation (the Lean
theorem alone would only show the model is self-consistent).

**The boundary, in two kinds, and they are not the same kind of omission.** *Fields omitted*:
`version`, `shardId`, `blockHash`, `preStateHash`, `postStateHash`, `bonds`, the three `rejected*` sets
and `sigAlgorithm` are in the proto and are not modelled here at all — that is C57's option (a).
*A field deliberately taken in the proto's shape*: `justifications` is `repeated bytes` in the proto and
a list of `Parent`s in the model, two representations of **different data** rather than two spellings of
one thing, so the encoder takes the proto's shape and the model's `Parent` stays outside. A reader who
"fixes" the second member back to `encodeParent` would be inventing a correspondence the node lacks.

**`state` is written unconditionally, and the observation is what decided that.** `prost`'s derive
writes a *present* sub-message even when it serialises to nothing ("present but empty" is not "absent");
the first row of the table below is the case where that is all that is written (`7200`), and the
observation confirmed it against the alternative reading, which would have skipped the field.

**This is the repository's first byte-level corpus layer.** Every other layer pins an identity (which
element sorts first, which token a spelling lexes to); a byte-level layer pins an *encoding*, and a
round trip cannot see either failure above (`from_bytes (to_bytes b) = b` holds under both orders and
every skipping rule). -/
