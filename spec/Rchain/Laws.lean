# The law register — every law, in one place, with what each one rests on

**The heartbeat ceiling, and why it is raised here rather than the rows shortened** (2026-10-08). A row
is mostly prose — `statement`, `note`, `falsifiable` — held as string literals in one structure, and the
elaborator's cost grows with the register. Adding law 17c and 17d's rows took seven declarations past
Lean's 200,000 default and the build failed with `(deterministic) timeout at \`elaborator\`` (at
`Laws.lean:446, 460, 482, 610, 640, 774, 814` — declarations that had been inside the budget, so the
number that moved is the *register's*, not theirs). The ceiling is raised here instead of the prose
being trimmed because the prose **is** the record: a `note` cut to fit a compiler budget is a note that
stopped saying what it knows, and this file's own history is a list of the times a hand-written claim
drifted from the tree. The same tool, for the same reason, is already used in `Print.lean`
(`8000000`), `ValueDepth.lean` and `Depth.lean` (`4000000`) and `Par.lean` (`1000000`). The number
below is 5× the default and still an order of magnitude under the heaviest block in the tree; if it
ever needs raising again, that is a signal about this module's shape rather than about Lean.

`spec/INVENTORY.md` is the prose catalog, and `docs/src/formal/laws.md`
— the folder's one-page rendering of the whole set — is its reader-facing counterpart, but
none of the three is *checkable*:
nothing noticed that the tree grew to 43 laws while both still
said 29, that the two tables contradicted each other on Laws 5 and 24, or that Law 1's "30 residual
axioms" were really 12. This module is the single source of truth those documents are generated from,
and `Rchain/LawsMain.lean` (the `rchain-laws` executable) is what enforces it:

1. **Numbering** — every law `1..lawCeiling` is present, with no gaps, so a law cannot be quietly
   dropped.
2. **Reference integrity** — every declaration a row names actually exists in `Rchain`. A renamed or
   deleted theorem fails this, instead of leaving a row that cites a proof that is gone.
3. **Axiom accounting** — the set of axioms cited by these rows is *exactly* the set of `axiom`
   declarations in the tree. This is the ratchet the `sorry` scan cannot be: `tools/check-lean-conformance.sh`
   catches a new `sorry`, but an `axiom` is how a law is usually assumed, and until this register existed
   a 63rd axiom was invisible.

## The status vocabulary, and why it is not "proven / stated"

The old vocabulary (`spec/INVENTORY.md`'s legend) had one word for two very different things. A law
proved *about the Lean model* and a law proved *and checked against the running node* both read
"proven", and the difference between them is exactly the difference that let C21 ship: the model's
`normalize_if` was never the question — the node's was.

- `provedTied` — proved, **and** tied to the node by a conformance corpus whose Rust consumer runs the
  same source text through the real thing (`spec/conformance/*.tsv`). The corpus is the only mechanical
  Lean↔Rust link this repo has. Check 5c requires one (a status that names a tie nothing checks is the
  word `proved-tied` with no tie behind it) and `corpusLayerFailures` requires the layer the row names to
  exist, so the two halves are enforced at the two levels they can be.
- `provedModel` — proved over the model; the tie to the Rust is prose in a mapping table. Honest, and
  weaker than it sounds: a `provedModel` law is a claim about a model that a human keeps in sync. A row
  may carry a corpus here too and still be `provedModel` — when the layer is *partial*, the model's
  algebra coarser than the node's — and then its note says why the corpus is not the tie the stronger
  word would claim.
- `axiomByDesign` — postulated because the primitive is cryptographic (the crypto law). The only status
  that should survive the work this register begins.
- `owed` — the definition exists and the proof does not.
- `deferred` — the `axiom` *is* the definition, so there is nothing yet to prove anything about.
  **Empty now**: the last examples (`substPar`, `joinKey`, `trieRoot`, `mergeChanges`) are definitions
  since the consolidation pass modelled the Rust's own.
- `open` — in the catalog, and its formalization is **not yet statable**: unlike `owed`, a definition is
  missing rather than a proof.
- `orphaned` — out of scope because the VM it describes was not ported.
- `retired` — the port has **no rule of this shape**, with the evidence in the row's note and its `rust`
  anchor (the code that was read). A decision recorded, not an omission: the alternative is an `open` row
  that will never close, which makes the count dishonest in the direction that matters least visibly.

**No bullet names law numbers, and that is a rule with a check behind it.** The lists that stood here
("(laws 30, 31, 33, 34, 36)" for `open`, "(laws 12, 13)" for `orphaned`) were wrong in four of five
entries by 2026-09-25 — every one of those rows had moved on — which is `spec/STYLE.md`'s own rule ("do
not restate a status in prose") broken in the one place a reader looks to learn the vocabulary.
`tools/audit-test-register.sh`'s check 12 now fails on a law number in a status bullet: the counts and the
per-row statuses live in `spec/laws.tsv`/`spec/LAWS.md`, which are emitted, and a reader who wants the
examples should read those.

`falsifiable` records what would have to be true for the law to be *false* — a witness, a negative case,
or the reason it cannot fail. A law that cannot fail constrains nothing: `numeric_channels_nonneg` was
`0 ≤ b.number` on a `Nat` (`Nat.zero_le`), and `finality_iff_supermajority` restated its own definition
(the pass has since deleted the first and re-scoped the second onto the finalizer's gate).
`none` means the witness is owed, and the count of those is the measure of how much of this catalog is
still unfalsifiable.

`witness` is `falsifiable`'s machine half — the Lean declarations the claim rests on, checked by name
exactly as `declarations` is. `falsifiable` itself is a sentence that mixes three kinds of name: Lean
declarations, Rust property tests (`an_open_value_at_the_variable_leaves_a_free_variable` in
`rholang/src/property_tests.rs`; `a_rigged_replay_matches_its_recorded_trace` in
`rspace/src/property_tests.rs`), and `file:line` references. Nothing read any of them, so a `falsifiable`
that had rotted — naming a theorem since renamed, or one never written — would have read exactly like a
live one. `witness` is the part that can be checked; a `proved*` row must name at least one declaration
or carry a `corpus`, and no witness may be an `axiom` — a row whose falsifier is the assumption that
cannot fail is naming decoration.

  merge "does not choose among candidates", so a law about a unique minimum-cost candidate has nothing to
  be stated against, and the honest close is to say so rather than leave the row owed forever. The
  requirement is what keeps the word from becoming a resting place: a `retired` row must carry the
  evidence in its note **and** a `rust` anchor naming the code that was read, because the claim being

  /-- **The Rust *tests* this law's claim rests on**, as `path.rs:symbol` anchors — the Rust
  counterpart of `witness`, and the rung between a conformance corpus and prose. `witness` is checked
  by name against the elaborated environment and nothing read the Rust names in `falsifiable`/`note`,
  so a test that asserts a row's own case was indistinguishable from a sentence about one; an anchor
  here must be a file that exists **and contains `fn <symbol>`** (`Rchain/LawsMain.lean`'s
  `rustAnchorFailures`), and `tools/check-rust-witnesses.sh` **runs** each one — refusing a name that
  matches no test, because `cargo test <filter>` exits 0 on an empty match and a registry of renamed
  or `#[ignore]`d tests would otherwise run green while checking nothing.
  What it is *not*: a witness is not a proof. A corpus outranks it (three verdicts read off the node
  beat one assertion), and a row whose statement is over an abstract relation the Rust does not have
  says so in its note rather than implying the witness covers it. Populated 2026-09-24 from the 65

  refutation (`*_is_false`), a negative case (`a_*`, `*_refuses_*`), a strictness or minimality fact, or
  the theorem that carries the claim where the law is a positive property with no failing instance in the
  model. Every name is checked against the elaborated environment, exactly like `declarations`; a
  `provedTied`/`provedModel` row must name at least one, or carry a `corpus` (the corpus *is* the
  falsifier for a tied row); and no name may be an `axiom` — a falsifier that cannot fail is not one.
  The standard is deliberately "the claim is anchored", not "a counterexample exists": a law of the shape
  `f (step p) ⊆ f p` has no failing instance *inside its own model*, so demanding one would produce
  filler witnesses, which is the failure mode the `vacuous` status exists to prevent. -/

      `conformance/sort.tsv`'s 42 verdicts, each `decide`d against the model's `cmpPar`, read back from \
      the node by which element `sort_par` puts first (`rholang/tests/lean_sort_corpus.rs`)",

      *declaration* order while the node sorts by its **score tree** \
      (`models/src/sorter.rs`'s `sort_send`/`sort_expr` build `node_score(tag, children)` with the tags \

      EVAR=100 < …`), and a reading of every `sort_*` against the model showed the divergence across \
      **eleven types** rather than the two the corpus first exhibited. Four structures were reordered to \
      the tags and are pinned by corpus rows 13–19, each verdict *observed* from the node (via \
      `sort_pars`) and the model corrected to it: a send's field order (`persistent` first — \
      `@\"a\"!!(1)` vs `@\"b\"!(1)` → `gt`), the par's own field order (`exprs` before `news`, \
      `unforgeables` last — `new x in { Nil } | 1` vs `[1]` → `lt`, and its reverse → `gt`), the \
      expression-class order (collections before vars and operators — `[1]` vs `1 + 2` → `lt`, `1 * 2` \
      vs `1 + 2` → `lt`, `1 - 2` vs `1 * 2` → `gt`), and `GBool`'s **polarity** (`true` scores 0 and \
      `false` 1, so `true` sorts first — `false` vs `true` → `gt`). Each row was falsified before it was \
      believed: restoring the old order stops `Rchain.Corpus`'s `sortCases_decide` from compiling, and \
      a runtime reporter names the row. **The rest could not be aligned without extending the model's \
      algebra** — 24 `Expr` constructors against the node's 33 when this was written, and the three the \
      re-tagging added were `ematches`/`eshortand`/`eshortor` — so it was a recorded boundary rather \
      than a fixed defect: `Receive`/`ReceiveBind`/`New`/`Bundle`/`EList`/`ESet`/`EMap`/`Var`/\
      `GUnforgeable` (where `gDeployerId`(10) sorts *before* `gDeployId`(11), the reverse of the port's \
      enum) / `Connective`; and the model then lacked **eight** `Expr`-level constructors, *counted* against \
      the node's tag table rather than summarised (AUDIT C58): `BIG_INT`(13), `EMETHOD`(115), \
      `EMATCHES`(118), `EPERCENT`(119), `EPLUSPLUS`(120), `EMINUSMINUS`(121), `ESHORTAND`(123), \
      `ESHORTOR`(124). **All eight are in the model as of 2026-09-25** — three were conflations \
      (below) and the other five were constructors (further below) — so the count is closed. **Three of those eight were *conflations* rather than missing arms, and all \
      three are closed** (re-measured 2026-09-25, and this sentence is the correction): `EMATCHES`, \
      `ESHORTAND` and `ESHORTOR` have constructors (`ematches`, `eshortand`, `eshortor`, \
      `Par.lean:67-69`), `Surface.lean`'s arms now **emit** them (`.eshortand`, `.eshortor`, \
      `.ematches` — they used to normalise `.matches`/`.shortAnd`/`.shortOr` onto `eeq`/`eand`/`eor`, \
      which made the model answer **`eq`** where the node's tag table says **`gt`**, a wrong verdict \
      on a statable pair), and `Rchain/Sort.lean`'s `exprTag` gives them the node's own tags — 118, \
      123 and 124. So the defect this paragraph described is *gone*, and what it left behind is the \
      boundary below. The genuinely missing five were `BIG_INT`(13), `EMETHOD`(115), \
      `EPERCENT`(119), `EPLUSPLUS`(120) and `EMINUSMINUS`(121), **and they are in the model as of \
      2026-09-25**: each is its own `Expr` class with the node's own tag, and corpus rows 26–42 pin \
      every one of them (each verdict read off the node before the row was written). Line them up and \
      the reason they were not \"five more arms\" is structural, and the fix is that structure rather \
      than more arms: the node's tags *interleave* (scalars 1–4, collections 6–9, `BIG_INT` 13, vars \
      50–52, operators 100–124, `EBYTEARR` 116) while a constructor-*kind* classification would put a \
      bigint with the other grounds (tag 0, ahead of `elist`(6)) and `EMETHOD`/the three operators \
      after every operator — so each of the five is a class of its own, and `exprTag` gives it the \
      node's literal. The two consequences the earlier note predicted are the two that landed: \
      `cmpExpr`'s arm-lemma family grew from 24 classes to 29 (5 pair lemmas, 5 extraction lemmas, \
      10 cross lemmas, and five arms in each of the three laws), and `emethod`'s score needed \
      `Rchain.Comparator.lex_lt_trans_at3` because its children are three deep. C58 carries the measurement of \
      the *gap*; the rows carry the closure. `Ground` is untouched and `ebigint` is an `Expr` leaf \
      because that is what the node has — the protobuf's `g_big_int` is an `Expr` variant and the \
      port's normalizer converts the parse-level ground into one (`normalizer.rs:74-77`). (`matches` was the \
      sixth of that list and is no longer on it: `ematches` has a constructor, a tag and an arm.) \
      `Ground.bytes` is the one \
      unpinnable divergence: the model has it at the wrong tag and the node's front end has no \
      byte-array literal, so the term is unspellable rather than merely mis-scored. `Rchain/Sort.lean`'s \
      note carries the table and the boundary. So the model's `sortPar` is now the node's `sort_par` over \
      the model's algebra rather than a claim about the wrong order (it was never a fork between nodes: \
      every node sorts by the score tree). The alignment is safe for the proofs: \
      `sortPar_idempotent`/`sortPar_comm` hold for any comparator, and \
      `eq_iff`/`swap`/`lt_trans` are order-independent, so the remaining axioms' statements do not change" },

      order (an element law needs the list lemma of the types *below* it and a list lemma needs the \
      element law of its own type, so the two families interleave — the order in `Rchain.Sort` is that \
      topological order, and it is why the section is not alphabetical). **The last two landed on \
      2026-09-24**: `cmpPar_lt_trans` is a theorem — an eight-component `lex` chain, a member of \
      `Rchain.Sort`'s `mutual` block because the family is one strongly connected component, which is \
      what that file's note is about — and `cmpExpr`'s three are theorems by the route that note \
      predicted (the 29 `@[simp]` arm lemmas (`simp only [cmpExpr.eq_def]`, one arm at a time) over `exprTag`, since `cmpExpr` is compiled as \
      `WellFounded.fix` and nothing unfolds it). This row's falsifier is therefore the **`sort` corpus**, \
      as it is law 1a's: its pairwise verdicts are read back from the node by which element `sort_par` \
      puts first, so a comparator whose order drifted from the node's score tree fails a row rather than \
      a proof — which is exactly how the alignment was found in the first place (law 1a's note). The \
      `rust` anchor is \
      `models/src/sorter.rs`, because the order these comparators specify *is* the node's score tree \
      (`node_score(tag, children)`, compared element-wise by `compare_children`), and the `sort` corpus \
      pins four structures of it against the node — see law 1a's note. **What the fourth pass did \
      (2026-09-24)**: `cmpPar_lt_trans` is a **theorem** — the seven-deep ladder whose shape an earlier \
      note recorded — and it is a member of `Rchain.Sort`'s `mutual` block rather than a theorem of its \
      own, because the family is one strongly connected component. What blocked the first attempt is \
      kept in that file's note with the fix: `Cmp.lean`'s pointwise `lex_lt_trans_at`, so each level's \
      `h_lt` is a partial application on *fields* — the only shape the block's termination checker \
      accepts — plus the last-component and binder-collision details. **What the fifth pass did \
      (2026-09-24)**: `cmpExpr_eq_iff` is a **theorem**, and the finding is why it took two attempts — \
      `cmpExpr` is compiled as `WellFounded.fix` (its block is one SCC), so *nothing* unfolds it: `rfl` \
      does not reduce it on constructors, `cmpExpr.eq_def` times out at `whnf`, and a 441-goal \
      `simp [cmpExpr]` overflows the stack. The access path is one **arm lemma at a time** \
      (`simp only [cmpExpr.eq_def]` under a stated heartbeat budget) plus a new `exprTag` numbering the \
      arm order for the cross cases — whose side conditions need `Nat.reduceLT` in the `simp only` set. \
      And the law has to be written **one arm at a time too, calling each sub-law on the arm's own \
      pattern variables**: a `decreasing_by` over the 441-goal `simp` version cannot work, because \
      `simp` picks the call arguments and the termination checker is then asked for \
      `sizeOf p < 1 + sizeOf a` with nothing identifying `p`. What is left of this row is `cmpExpr`'s \
      none. `lt_trans` needed the tags rather than 9261 cases, and the arm machinery made \
      `eq_iff`/`swap` ordinary case analyses" },

      sends, receives and their binds, `new`, match cases, bundles, connectives and expressions, with \
      the list walks the port writes as loops, the splice a substituted occurrence performs \
      (`par_concat`, imported at `substitute.rs:13` and defined in `models/src/par_ops.rs:143`, \
      called in-file at `substitute.rs:56` and `:73`, `:160`, `:161`), the depth gate (`0` \
      substitutes, `d ≥ 1` is a pattern position, \
      `maybe_substitute_var` `substitute.rs:24-40`), and the set/map children sorted inside the recursion \
      (`sort_pars` `substitute.rs:437`, `sort_pairs` `:454`). Three differences from the port are *representational* and are written up in the \
      file: the model's `Var` is level-based so there is no environment `shift` to do under binders \
      (`env.rs:36-41`), `σ` is total where the port's `Env` is partial and errors on a \
      `FreeVar`/`Wildcard` at depth 0, and the port's bundle-of-bundle merge has no model counterpart. \
      **What that buys**: the two laws are now statements about a *function*, so they are falsifiable \
      instance by instance rather than postulates over nothing — the earlier vacuity is gone \
      (`noSubst`, `the_identity_satisfies_*` are kept for the record: they show the laws *alone* never \
      identified substitution, which is why the definition had to be written). **What is owed**: both \
      laws are still axioms, the proofs being the mutual induction over the twelve functions plus the \
      list facts; the closedness one carries the closed-image hypothesis, which the previous version \
      **lacked the hypothesis that makes it true**: `Closed` is `Ty.lean`'s \"no `Var.free`\" \
      (`closedVar` counts `bound` as closed), so for `σ` mapping a bound variable to an open term the \
      conclusion is false of any operation that actually substitutes \
      (`bound_is_closed_free_is_not`). The Rust's own test carries exactly that hypothesis \
      (`law3_substituting_a_closed_value_keeps_the_term_closed`, whose value is `arb_closed`), so the \
      statement is narrowed to `∀ v, Closed (σ v) → Closed t → Closed (substPar σ t)`. What closes \
      this row is Programme D's unit 5: define `substPar` by mirroring the code the law describes \
      (`rholang/src/substitute.rs:164` — an `Env<Par>` keyed by de Bruijn level with a shift, and a \
      `depth` incremented inside receive and match-case *patterns*), at which point both laws become \
      theorems about a definition. **And that is what happened (2026-09-24)**: the closedness law is a \
      *theorem* now — `subst_closed`'s statement unchanged, resting on a `mutual` **theorem** block over \
      the substitution family (21 members, one per helper) that states the checker-level facts \
      (`closed … = true`), with `closed_eq_Closed` carrying it back to the `Closed` form the law is \
      written in. The route this note predicted — a strong induction over the sum type — was **not \
      needed**: the mutual-theorem idiom `Sort.lean`'s comparator laws use carries this family too, and \
      the obstruction the earlier attempts hit was a *shape*, not a measure (the `termination_by` clause \
      must name a prefix of the equation patterns, so the members use variable patterns with the \
      destructuring inside). It needs `set_option maxHeartbeats 1000000`, measured. **And the commuting \
      law is proved too (2026-09-24)**: `sort_subst` is a *theorem* now, statement unchanged, resting on \
      a `mutual` block of 22 members — one per helper of the substitution family. What it needed beyond \
      the same induction is three shapes `Sort.lean` did not have: `sortList_append_congr` (a \
      substituted occurrence is spliced in by `parMerge`, so `sortList` of an *append* has to be a \
      function of the two sorts), `sortPar_parMerge` (the merge congruence), and `sortList_cons` (the \
      sorted form of a field is an `orderedInsert`, which an induction has to take apart); plus \
      permutation invariance of the two `parMerge` folds (`substExprsToPar`, `substListConnective`), \
      since `sortPar` sees a `parMerge` tree only as its sorted fields. The part worth keeping is a \
      *failure*: the ten list members cannot be a single application of `sortList_map_congr`, because \
      that applies the element law to an *arbitrary* element of the list and no termination measure \
      justifies it — Lean rejects the block — so they are structural inductions whose only two calls, \
      the head's element law and the tail's theorem, are subterms. This row has **no axioms of its \
      own**: `sort_subst` was the last one, and what the row's theorems still rest on is `cmpExpr`'s \

      `UnexpectedReuseOfNameContextFree`/`…ProcContextFree`). **Probed on a devnet** (AUDIT C42): \
      `for (@[v, v] <- x)`, `for (v <- x & v <- y)` and `for (@{\"k\": v, ...v} <- x)` each return 400 \
      with `Free variable v is used twice as a binder …`, while a duplicated *datum* \
      (`x!([*a, *a])` against `for (@[p, q] <- x)`) returns 200 with the same unforgeable hash twice. \
      **The matcher now enforces it itself, and this is what C42 changed** (2026-09-24): `spatial_match` \
      (`spatial_matcher.rs:227`) is `if !linear(pattern) { no match }` followed by the clauses, which \
      moved to `spatial_match_core` — the same split, with the same names, that the model makes \
      (`spatialMatch … && linear pattern`) — and the store's own entry reaches the clauses the same \
      way, `RhoMatch::get` handing `&spatial_match` to `fold_match` (`rholang/src/storage.rs:75`). `linear` \
      (`models/src/types.rs:93`) is the walk `freeLevelsOfPar` mirrors, levels and all. **One guard is \
      enough, and that is an argument rather than a hope**: the clauses descend only into sub-terms \
      `linear`'s own walk reaches — a send's channel and data, a receive's body, a `new`'s body, a \
      `match`'s target and cases, a bundle's, a connective's members, a collection's elements — so a \
      sub-pattern's free levels are a sub-multiset of the whole pattern's, and a linear pattern has \
      only linear sub-patterns. Guarding every recursive call would re-walk the pattern at each depth \
      and buy nothing. The clauses' plain `insert` is still what they do — `freeMapMerge_overwrites` \
      is still the model's statement of that — and what the guard changes is that no pattern reaching \
      them carries a repeated level. **`aggregate_updates` stays as the inner check** \
      (`spatial_matcher.rs:686-696`): it reads the free maps the collection path's bipartite search \
      produced, each element having been matched from a fresh map (`:812`), and refuses a level that \
      two of them introduced — a clash *between bindings* rather than a property of the pattern, which \
      is the sense in which the entry guard does not subsume it as a check. From a term it has no \
      reachable producer any more (the normalizer refuses those shapes first), and the model keeps \
      both halves: `aggregateUpdates_rejects_double_bind` for the check and `freeMapMerge_overwrites` \
      for the clauses — and **both are theorems**, which is what this row's debt was \
      (`aggregateUpdates_rejects_double_bind` at `Match.lean:477`, `freeMapMerge_overwrites` at \
      `:489`; the file declares no axiom, so neither rests on one). The **tie** this row once shared is \
      law 37's and is **proved** there (`spatialMatches_iff_eq`) — the row is `proved-tied` on the \
      `match` corpus, whose three-valued verdicts are the node's half. \
      **A third thing this row's corpus found** (AUDIT C44): the clauses had no arm for a \
      **tuple**, which the port matches (`spatial_matcher.rs:538-544`) — so a tuple pattern the node \
      matches read as silence here, and the law's own statement was false of the model until \
      `modelledPar` was added to it. Cases 15/16 of `spec/conformance/match.tsv` are the pair that \
      caught it; the arm is not an axiom, it is a clause. **A fourth thing, and it is the one that \
      matters most** (AUDIT C50, 2026-09-24, found while *attempting* `fuel_saturation`): the fuel did \
      not pay for a **tuple's** walk. `parNodesExpr` had no `etuple` arm, so a tuple's contents were \
      charged to no node while the tuple clause walks them exactly as the list arm does — the budget \
      stayed constant as the nesting deepened. Two levels need 13 and were given 12, so the model \
      answered `false` where the node answers `true`, on a shape needing **no** padding (`@((1, 2), \
      (3, 4))` against itself; a search over 300 generated shapes rejected 40, and three-deep tuples \
      were rejected at every depth the measure could reach). Case 20 of `spec/conformance/match.tsv` is \
      the ratchet that would have caught it. The reason this belongs in the row rather than only in \
      AUDIT: **`concrete_matches_iff_eq` was *false* while the defect stood** — a tuple three deep is \
      `modelledPar`, connective-free and equal to itself, so its conclusion evaluated to `false = \
      true`. The refutation is two lines of `decide` and is *not* kept, because with the measure fixed \
      the same `decide` fails; what the episode says is that this row's axiom is only as true as the \
      fuel beneath it, which is exactly what `fuel_saturation` is for. **And the tie's own axiom was \
      false, so it is gone** (AUDIT C51, same day, found by asking what the statement says of a value \
      the model *admits*): `modelledPar` accepts a `Par` with two expressions, and the clauses have no \
      arm that accepts a multi-expression pattern, so the pattern is modelled, connective-free, equal \
      to itself and rejected — the tie's conclusion is `false = true` on it \
      (`a_two_expression_pattern_refutes_the_modelled_tie`). Same class as C44 one level up: not a \
      missing *clause* but a missing *hypothesis*. What this row owes is the tie for a pattern whose \
      expression list is a **singleton** — the shapes the clauses have an arm for — and it is owed \
      rather than asserted, because a statement about the model has to say what the model does on every \
      value it admits, not only the ones a stored datum can be. **A third hypothesis, found by probing \
      the domain rather than by reading it** (2026-09-24, AUDIT C54, and it cost one reverted change): \
      the collections' **contents must be canonical** beside the singleton list. A target with a \
      duplicated set element is matched by a shorter pattern in the model (`spatialMatch @{1, 1} @{1}` \
      answers `true` while `@{1, 1} ≠ @{1}`), so the tie is false on it — and the shape is \
      **unreachable**, because the node evaluates a set through `par_set`, which deduplicates and sorts \
      (`models/src/sorter.rs:834`, reached from `reduce.rs:783`), so no stored datum carries a duplicate. \
      Narrowing the statement to the invariant the code maintains is Law 10's `WellFormed` move again — \
      the model has no deduplicating set constructor to widen it with. The first attempt at this row \
      instead changed the *clauses* to enforce the port's no-remainder length check, which the corpus \
      consumer rejected on its first run — it reports the node answering `true`; C54 carries that record, and the \
      lesson is that a model change here is not believed until `lean_match_corpus` has run. \
      **The Coq half, split by kind** (2026-09-23): \
      `spec/coq/Laws.v`'s `linear` is a **definition** now (with `linear_decidable` and the witness \
      `a_double_binding_is_not_linear`), mirroring Lean's own predicate; `spatial_matches` stays a \
      **signature**, because mirroring the matcher in Coq is the analogue of this file's owed proofs \
      and not part of the honest-and-gated tier. \
      **And the member was over-claiming, which the guard fixes** (2026-09-24). Measured on the node \
      through the receive path and *then* `decide`d: `@Set(2)` against `Set(1, 2)` and `@{\"b\": 2}` \
      against `{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}` answer **false** there while the model answered `true` — the walk \
      drops leading targets, and with no remainder and no wildcard the port refuses an unequal length \
      before it searches at all (`exact_match = !wildcard && remainder.is_none()`, then \
      `if exact_match && plen != tlen`, `spatial_matcher.rs:684-693`). The clause now carries that \
      guard, and corpus rows 21/22 are the node's half of it. **This is AUDIT C54's reverted change \
      re-landed**, and why it was withdrawn is the part worth keeping: the row written for it \
      (`@Set(1)` against `Set(1, 1)`) is answered `true` by the node, because `par_set` deduplicates \
      what `eval_expr` stores — so that row compared the model's *literal* against a different \
      *value*, and the conclusion drawn from it (\"there was no defect\") does not follow. The guard \
      was right; the row was not. **The opposite direction is a residue rather than a repair**: a \
      pattern *permuted* relative to the target (`@Set(2, 1)`, `@Set(x, 1)` against `Set(1, 2)`) is \
      matched by the node, whose assignment backtracks, and refused by the walk here, which cannot \
      reorder. The two agree on canonical inputs — the tie's domain — and widening the walk is a \
      *measure* change, not another clause (a backtracking search needs a fuel at least quadratic in \
      the nodes where `matchFuel` is linear), so it is pinned by `a_permuted_pattern_is_refused` and \
      said here rather than left implicit" },

      message's seen set is **constructed** as the union of its justifications' seen sets plus its own id \
      (`message_state.rs:54-59`), which the model now has (`seenOf`, with both halves proved: \
      `seenOf_contains_justifications` and `mem_seenOf_self`); and height monotonicity relates \
      *successive* fringes of one validator, which the finalizer's advance gate produces \
      (`finalizer.rs:275-317`, `:361-363`). **The transitive closure is proved, along the relation that does not need a lookup** (2026-09-24): \
      `Reaches a b` (a is a justification of b, or of a justification that reaches it) gives \
      `a.seen ⊆ b.seen` by induction (`seen_monotone_of_reaches`), and the hypothesis it needs — that a \
      message's seen set *is* `seenOf` of its justifications — is the port's own construction \
      (`message_state.rs:54-59`), stated rather than assumed. Falsified by mutation: a `seenOf` that \
      drops the union breaks both the one-step lemma and this proof's two steps. **And both things this \
      form did not cover arrived with the DAG model** (2026-09-24, `Rchain/Casper/Dag.lean`): the \
      literal id-based form is `seen_subset_of_mem_seen`, over `Dag.msg` — the id→message map this note \
      said the model would have to bring — with the port's construction (`Constructed`) and the DAG's \
      ordering facts (`Descends`: a parent resolves in the DAG and is strictly lower) as **hypotheses \
      rather than axioms**, because resolving an id back to a value needs uniqueness and a finite \
      descent. **And the descent is *enforced* rather than assumed** (H1b, `46c35b545`): `blockNumber` \
      refuses a block that names a resolved parent at or above its own number, the **failed** ones \
      included (`casper/src/validate.rs:226-230`), so `Descends` holds of **every state the port \
      admits** — where the reference validator, which filters failed parents out of its own \
      `blockNumber`, admits the violating block, the §6 deviation AUDIT C83 carries. The earlier plan \
      to weaken this to *unfailed* parents is therefore **superseded**: a weakened `Descends` forces \
      `unfailed` into `seen_subset_of_mem_seen`'s descent step, while the strong form is what the \
      ingress check guarantees. The per-sender reading of the height claim rests on `selfParents_skips_finalized`: the \
      walk filters by `!finalized.contains(x)` **and never traverses through an excluded message** (the \
      worklist is rebuilt from the survivors), so a min message is the previous sentinel's direct \
      successor rather than a descendant of something older. **And that settled which reading of the \
      height claim is true**: the cross-sender one is **false**, of this tree and of the oracle — \
      `prev = {m3 (sender 0, height 3)}` against a published `{q2 (sender 1, height 2)}`, because the \
      layer is built from the *justifications* and need not cover the senders `prev` covers, and the \
      gate cannot see it: what `calculate_fringe` reads is the **support map**, while \
      `Finalizer.scala:144-178` compares fringes *never* \
      (`LazyList.unfold(parentFringe)(nextFringe(_).map(nf => (nf, nf))).lastOption`). It is kept as \
      `cross_sender_height_monotone_is_false` rather than dropped, so the next reader sees which \
      reading was false and on what; AUDIT C69 carries the measurements, and §6 the port's own \
      termination guard — which the oracle does not have, and which is weaker than a cycle guard. \
      **What remains owed** is the last conjunct: the per-sender height *comparison* itself, the \
      mechanism proved and the arithmetic across a chain not — a small named remainder rather than the \
      two-sided gap this row used to carry. **And the statement it needs is sharper than it looks**: as \
      written the comparison is *false*, because the walk takes **every** same-sender parent, so a \
      same-sender fork on `mv`'s frontier puts a message from the other branch in its output, and that \
      branch is not below any given sentinel. **And the port does not merely happen to be fork-free — it \
      *refuses* a same-sender fork at ingress**, which is stronger than the datum this sentence used to \
      assert and is what the proof's hypothesis can lean on: H-1's equivocation detection rejects a \
      second distinct block by one sender reusing a `seq_num`, **before any partial write** \
      (`casper/src/dag.rs:244-252`, test `insert_rejects_equivocation_same_seq_num` at `:568`); \
      `sequence_number` requires a block to justify a same-sender block exactly one `seq_num` lower \
      (`casper/src/validate.rs:245-262`, test `sequence_number_must_be_creator_latest_plus_one` at \
      `:813`); and `check_justification_regression` admits at most one justification per sender and \
      demands that it be the latest (`casper/src/validate.rs:267-279`). **Why the port refuses it, and \
      why that refusal is a deviation the oracle does not share, is AUDIT C84** — the Scala has no \
      equivocation gate anywhere and its `validateDagState` checks only height contiguity, so the \
      premise this proof needs is **guaranteed here and only observed there**. H-1 landed **2026-08-20** \
      (`76415d6c6`), a month *before* the sentence it corrects was written — so the premise was carried \
      in good faith rather than checked, which is this programme's recurring class. The hypothesis is \
      therefore \"at most one same-sender parent per message\" — **guaranteed by an ingress refusal** \
      rather than observed of the data — and with it the comparison \
      follows from the boundary plus the descent. That is the shape of the last conjunct, named so \
      the next pass proves a true statement rather than a forked counterexample. The old row's claim that the seen set is monotone \"(no \
      regression)\" was true of the port and false of the value the axiom quantified over. **And the \
      owed conjunct's *step* was wrong until 2026-09-25** (AUDIT C93): `minMsgs` takes the *oldest* \
      non-finalized same-sender ancestor — the port's `chain.into_iter().last()` over \
      `[p] ++ self_parents p` — and the model read `getLast?` of `selfParents`, whose list is \
      **oldest-first** (the model prepends into its accumulator where the port `push`es its visit order, \
      so the port's chain is newest-first and its `.last()` is the oldest). Measured on a chain \
      `10 (h 0) ← 11 (h 1) ← 12 (h 2)`: the model's `selfParents` is `[10, 11]`, the port's chain is \
      `[11, 10]`, and the model answered `11` where the port answers `10` — the *newest* for the oldest. \
      **No test could see it**: every `decide`d instance in the file gave a sender at most one \
      same-sender ancestor, and with one element both ends agree, so a step of the derivation read the \
      opposite end of the chain while every check stayed green. The fix is `.head?`, pinned by \
      `chain3`'s two theorems (`the_walk_is_oldest_first` and `a_chain_of_three_picks_the_oldest`, the \
      instance that fails under `getLast?` — verified by reverting it), and the antichain above is \
      unaffected: which of two same-sender messages the layer fold keeps does not change its keys. \
      **What remains owed is still the comparison itself**, and it is now **one step narrower, with the \
      step named** (2026-09-25). A sentence here briefly said the obstacle was a *missing model* — that \
      `nextFringe` takes the next layer as an argument (`Fringe.lean:110`) so no two successive fringes \
      are related; **that was wrong**, a reading of `Fringe.lean` alone: `Rchain/Casper/Dag.lean`'s \
      `derivedFringe` derives the layer from the DAG *and* takes `prev` (`:140`), so the successive-fringe \
      relation exists. What is now **proved**, about the walk that derivation rests on, is the **sentinel \
      half**: `selfParents_above_a_finalized_ancestor` — for a justification, `minMsgs` returns a message \
      **strictly above every finalized same-sender ancestor of it** — under `NoFork`, the fork-freedom \
      ingress *refuses* rather than assumes (H-1 at the DAG insert, `sequence_number`, \
      `check_justification_regression`; AUDIT C82 and C84). Two things make it more than a spelling: the \
      walk's descent is proved first (`selfParents_height_lt`: everything the walk returns is reached \
      from the seed along same-sender parent edges, so `Descends` makes it strictly lower), and the \
      hypothesis is **falsified where it is dropped** — `the_comparison_is_false_without_fork_freedom` \
      exhibits a four-message fork where the walk steps *around* the finalized ancestor and returns a \
      height-1 message beneath a height-5 one. **What is still owed is the lift through the fold, and \
      *which* ingress rule it needs is a question two refutations narrowed without settling** — both \
      machine-checked rather than argued. `nextLayer` adds the min messages' *candidate parents* whose \
      sender is already a key (`:129-135`), and **neither fork-freedom nor the sequence rule excludes a \
      published message below the previous fringe**: `fold4` (two sender-0 blocks, `99` at height 2 and \
      `100` at height 5, neither with a parent, and `101` justifying `99`) is **fork-free** and still \
      publishes `99`, and `fold5` answers the next guess by adding `z` (seq 6) justifying `q` (seq 5) — so \
      every same-sender edge has consecutive `seqNum`s and the sequence rule holds — and it *still* \
      publishes the lower `c`, because `cands` is folded right-to-left and a candidate from an earlier \
      justification wins the sender's slot over the min message \
      (`the_fold_can_publish_below_the_previous_fringe`, with \
      `fold4_is_fork_free`, `fold5_is_fork_free` and `fold5_satisfies_the_sequence_rule` proving each \
      instance *has* the hypothesis it tests — the two refutation instances, and the two checks on the \
      fold that now mirrors the port). **And the fold itself was the thing in the way, which is now fixed rather than argued about.** The port's `calculate_next_layer` gives a candidate its sender's slot **only when its `sender_seq` is strictly greater** (`block-storage/src/dag/finalizer.rs:160-166`), and the port's own comment calls that guard *\"the Law 15 monotonicity invariant\"* (`message_state.rs:77`). `layerInsert` did not: it is the *seeding* rule (the port's `BTreeMap::collect`, last wins) and the model used it for the candidates too, justified by *\"the antichain does not depend on that choice\"* — true of law 14b's **keys**, false of the **message** law 15 is about. `seedLayer` and `insertCandidate` now carry both rules, and the difference shows on this file's own instance: `dag3`'s published layer was [10, 12] and is now [11, 12] — the model was publishing a **stale** same-sender message, which no law-14b check could see because the *keys* were right either way. **With the faithful fold the counterexample is `fold4` and nothing else**, stated per sender as law 15 states it: `the_fold_can_publish_below_the_previous_fringe` holds of a fork-free DAG whose `101` justifies the older `99` while `100` is finalized — a shape the **sequence rule** refuses, since `101`'s same-sender justification is not its sender's latest. `fold5` refutes nothing now: with the guard it publishes `z` (height 6) for sender 0 and the comparison holds (`the_guard_keeps_the_newer_message`, `the_comparison_holds_on_fold5`). **So the lift's hypothesis is the sequence rule, on a fold that mirrors the port** — which is what this row said before two of its own corrections, and it is now what the machine says rather than what a guess said. **And the lift is proved** (2026-09-25), so the row is no longer owed anything: the last two ingredients \
      are `seqNum_lt_height_lt` (on a sender, a higher `seqNum` is a higher height — from `SeqStep`, the \
      port's `sequence_number`, with `SeqUnique`, H-1's one-message-per-`seq_num`) and \
      `insertCandidate_height_le` (**the guarded insertion never lowers a sender's entry** — the port's \
      *\"Law 15 monotonicity invariant\"* as a theorem about this model's own fold). The composition is \
      `foldl_insertCandidate_height_le`: the step over the **whole** candidate list, whose accumulator is \
      generalized because the entry between two insertions is neither the seed's nor the layer's and it is \
      the one the next step's guard is about — and `nextLayer_height_le_seed` reads it where the row \
      needs it: a sender's entry in the layer `nextLayer` **publishes** is at a height no lower than the \
      **seeded** one. The comparison against `prev` is `minMsgs_above`, and the relation it needs is \
      exactly the one this row had named: every justification of a sender descends from the previous \
      fringe's message for that sender — the port's `sequence_number` plus \
      `check_justification_regression`, stated as the **hypothesis** it is rather than assumed, because \
      it is a fact about what a block may justify and not about the DAG value. \
      `nextLayer_above_the_previous_fringe` composes the two halves (per sender, the published layer lies \
      **strictly above** the previous fringe's message), and \
      `derivedFringe_above_the_previous_fringe` reads it at the `Fringe` `derivedFringe` returns — law \
      15's sentence with its hypothesis named. **What makes the hypotheses more than spelling**: `d15` \
      carries all four and a derivation that publishes (`d15_descends`, through a `Bool` mirror because \
      `Descends` quantifies over every message; `d15_is_fork_free`, `d15_is_sequence_unique`, \
      `d15_satisfies_the_sequence_rule`, each `decide`d), `d15_the_published_entry` pins the entry the \
      layer holds for the sender, and `d15_the_comparison_holds` is the theorem **applied** to it — \
      height 1 against height 2 — so no hypothesis is idle. The `rustWitness` is unchanged and stays a \
      **property test** (`block-storage/src/property_tests.rs:law15_adding_blocks_only_grows_the_state`): \

      and `a_body_encoder_that_canonicalises_is_not_injective` (`to_proto` sorts the justifications \
      before hashing, `casper_message.rs:636`, so it cannot distinguish a body from the same body \
      permuted). **And the axiom is gone**, so the refutation is now about the *definition the port \

      exhibits `2^63` and `2^63 + 2^64` as one image of `encodeBody` itself, and `Canonical`'s number \

      `Canonical` from `encodeBody_injective` and the proof breaks at `decodeBody_encodeBody`, which \
      returns `canonicalise b` — a different body exactly when the hypothesis fails",
    note := "**the old row was a postulate about a field no function computed** — `hash = \
      Blake2b256(block − {hash, sig})` over `Block.hash : Nat`, which the note below it admitted was not \
      true even of its own model (an injective `Nat → Nat` does not exist). `Block.hash` is gone; the \
      hash is *computed* (`blockHash`), and the content addressing is a **theorem**: the composition of \
      Law 19's collision-freedom with the serializer's canonicity. The two axioms that remain are Law \
      10's shape and for the same stated reason — a hash can make an encoding collision-resistant but \
      never canonical, so `encodeBody`'s injectivity is the serializer's assumption, not the hash's. \
      The body is the **hashed** body: the port hashes every field except `block_hash` and `sig` \
      (`proto_util.rs:58-64`, `BlockMessage` at `casper_message.rs:563-585`), so the model carries the \
      timestamp and the rest of the header, and `blockHash_changes_with_header` is the statement a \
      narrower body could not make. **What the third pass found (2026-09-23)**: the canonicity axiom \
      was still stated over types wider than the port's — a `Nat` block number against the proto's \
      `int64`, and `justifications` in arrival order against the sorted order `to_proto` writes — so it \
      was false of any encoder the port could be using, and the two refutation theorems above say so \
      with witnesses. The statement was narrowed to `Canonical` rather than the model widened (the \
      widths and the sorted order are properties of the *code*, which the model's validation rules \
      deliberately do not carry, since they fold over the list in any order). **The fourth pass \
      (2026-09-23) discharged it**: `encodeBody` is now a **definition** (`Rchain/Casper/Validate.lean`) \
      over protobuf's wire format (`Rchain/Proto.lean`: the base-128 `varint` and its self-delimiting \
      decode, `varintField`, `bytesField`, the 64-bit narrowing), with the round trip \
      (`decodeBody_encodeBody` — the encoder's own inverse returns `canonicalise b`, which is the \
      hypothesis's whole content) and injectivity (`encodeBody_injective`) as theorems about it, so this \
      row's axiom citation is empty. **What is still prose, and is named rather than implied**: `prost`'s \
      `encode_to_vec` is an external crate (0.13.5, `Cargo.lock`), so \"these bytes are the node's \
      bytes\" is a tie no Lean theorem can make — and it is now a tie the row **carries**: `corpus := \
      some \"body\"`, the layer that was the follow-up when this sentence was written (`Corpus.lean`'s \
      `bodyCases`, `emit-lean-corpus.sh`'s `LAYERS`, `spec/conformance/body.tsv`, the consumer \
      `node/tests/lean_body_corpus.rs`, the gate's layer-to-consumer map). The row is `proved-tied` on \
      it. **What the layer had to overcome was measured before it was built rather than after** (AUDIT \
      C57): the model's `encodeBody` and `prost` disagree in three ways that a byte comparison hits on \
      its first case — the model writes tags 4, 6, 5, 17, 9, 14 where `prost` writes the `.proto`'s \
      ascending order; `prost` omits default-valued fields and the model writes unconditionally; and the \
      model collapses nine fields \
      into one opaque `header` blob at tag 14, which `prost` reads as `state`. **What the layer covers is \
      the subset where the two structures correspond** — six fields, with the fields it does not model \
      and `justifications`' shape named as its boundary in the consumer's own doc — so what remains is \
      C57's \
      *option (a)*: mirroring `prost` over the full field list is a modelling change and not a plumbing \
      one, and it would put `decodeBody_encodeBody`/`encodeBody_injective` in play for those fields too. \
      C57 records the three \
      divergences, the compile-time hazard below, and the bounded alternative. **A \
      measurement worth keeping**: the first spelling of `decodeBody` was a `guard`-per-tag do-block, \
      and it did not slow the *elaborator* down — it slowed the **compiler** down: `lean --profile` \
      reports 128 ms of elaboration and `compilation of Rchain.decodeBody took 98.6s`, with the build \
      swelling past 5 GB until it aborted. One `taggedVarint` per field compiles in 224 ms" },

      carried needed correcting, which is the part worth keeping**: `validShardId (s.child n) = \
      validShardId s` is **false in both directions** — the *model's* `shardChild` joins the path with \
      no check, so a non-ASCII name yields an id `TryFrom` would have refused; and an invalid parent can \
      have a valid child (`shardChild \"\" \"x\" = \"/x\"`), which holds of the port too. **The port's \

      refuses an empty or non-ASCII name and returns `Result` (`shared/src/refined.rs:411-425`, whose \

      the oracle, and it is **closed**; this row states the corrected form rather than the convenient \
      one, with the refuted version kept beside it so the next reader does not re-derive it. **And the \

      what the `BTreeMap` sites observe is `shardChild_prefix` (the child's path carries the parent's) \
      plus the two `decide`d instances; the general \"a child sorts after its parent\" is *statable*, \

      *because* a corpus case contradicted it (AUDIT C26), the fuel bound was one step short until the \
      `decide` refused to compile, and `concrete_matches_iff_eq` **was false as stated** until case 15 \
      — a tuple pattern, which the port matches (`spatial_matcher.rs:538-544`) and the clauses had no \
      arm for — made the `decide` refuse (AUDIT C44). Two further cases are the model's own defects, \
      one in each direction: case 18 (`@Set(1, ..._)` against `Set(Nil × 6, 1)`) is a match the model \
      *under*-claimed because the fuel's measure counted an empty `Par` as zero nodes while the set \
      member walks past it (AUDIT C47), and case 19 (`@[1, ..._]` against `[Nil, 1]`) is a match the \
      model *over*-claimed because the list arm was wired to the searcher (AUDIT C48) — the direction \
      the boundary note says the corpus exists to catch. The tie still carries `modelledPar` on both \
      sides, and `arithmetic_pattern_refutes_the_unrestricted_tie` is the term that says why it must: a \
      concrete arithmetic pattern equals itself and no clause matches it. Its domain is **three** \
      hypotheses by now — `modelledPar` on both sides, a singleton pattern expression list, and canonical \
      collection contents — and the third is AUDIT C54's: a target whose set carries a duplicate element \
      is matched by a shorter pattern in the model and is unconstructible on the node, so the statement \
      needs the invariant `par_set` maintains rather than a clause the model lacks",
    note := "shares the tie axiom with Law 5; its `fuel_saturation` is **discharged** now (2026-09-24) — \
      worth saying here because the tie is only as true as the fuel beneath it, and under the short \
      measure the tie was *false* (a tuple three deep is `modelledPar` and unmatchable when the fuel \
      ran out — AUDIT C50). **The tie's domain was too wide, not merely unproved**: \
      `connectiveUsed pattern = false` admits an arithmetic pattern, which is concrete and unmatchable, \
      so the statement was false of the model — the same class as C26 and C40, found by asking what the \
      statement says on a term the model has. **And it was false a second time, for a second reason \
      (AUDIT C51)**: with `modelledPar` as the only domain predicate the tie still admitted a `Par` with \
      **two** expressions, which the clauses reject while the value equals itself — so the axiom is \
      **deleted** and what the row owes is the tie for a **singleton** pattern, the shapes the clauses \
      cover (`a_two_expression_pattern_refutes_the_modelled_tie` is the ratchet, and the lesson is that \
      a domain predicate has to be checked against *every* value the model admits, not the ones a \
      reachable datum can be). **The clauses are form-specific** and that is load-bearing \
      in both directions: a list or tuple is positional (`fold_match`, the port's `EList`/`ETuple` \
      arms), a set or map searches (`list_match_single` → `find_matches`), and `matchListPos`/\
      `matchListPar` are the two members; `match.tsv` cases 18/19 pin one direction each. \
      **The set/map member's third direction, measured and then fixed** (2026-09-24, row 5's note \
      carries the detail): the walk over-claimed a *shorter canonical* pattern against a *longer \
      canonical* target, where the port refuses an unequal length before searching \
      (`spatial_matcher.rs:684-693`). The clause now has that guard, corpus rows 21/22 hold the node \
      to it, and the opposite residue — a permuted pattern, which the node matches and the walk \
      cannot — is pinned by `a_permuted_pattern_is_refused`. The tie's domain is therefore the \
      **canonical** shapes, where the walk and the port's backtracking assignment agree: not the \
      duplicate-element corner only (C54), but the sorted-and-duplicate-free form on both sides, \
      which is what `sortPar` fixes for the model's collections and `par_set` for the node's.       **And the domain itself was wrong, not just unproved** (2026-09-24, AUDIT C60): `modelledPar` plus       a singleton expression list plus canonical contents still admits a shape the clauses reject —       nest a two-expression `Par` inside a collection and the *inner* list is not a singleton, so       `spatialMatch` answers `false` for the value against itself while it is modelled and       connective-free (`a_nested_multi_expression_par_is_outside_the_path_domain`). The hypothesis has       to hold at *every* level, and `pathPar` is that predicate — a `Par` whose fields but `exprs` are       empty, holding exactly one expression, that expression a ground or a collection of `pathPar`s       with no remainder. It is what \"the shapes the clauses cover\" was always meant to name, and       `linear_of_pathPar` is the free-level consequence the row used to leave implicit. **AUDIT C60       also measures what the domain leaves out, and it is not all unmodelled shapes**: the port's       matcher never reaches these clauses for a *concrete* pattern at all — it short-circuits at       `if !pattern.connective_used { pattern == target }` (`spatial_matcher.rs:235-237`, named as such       in the port's own normalizer at `normalizer.rs:1601`) — and both sides of a real match are       already canonical, because the RSpace payload types are `Sorted<Par>`       (`models/src/runtime.rs:20-36`). Measured: the node **matches** `@Set(1 | 2)` against itself       (`true`) where the clauses here answer `false`. Closing that is a modelling change to       `spatialMatch` — the short-circuit and the canonicalization — rather than a clause, and it is       named as the row's next step instead of being assumed. **The tie is half proved** (2026-09-24): \
      `spatialMatches_imp_eq` is the *soundness* direction — an accepted match forces equality — over
      `pathPar` on both sides. It rests on nothing but the clauses: a six-member `mutual` family in
      `Match.lean` (`eq_of_core`/`eq_of_exprs`/`eq_of_expr`/`eq_of_listPos`/`eq_of_listPar`/`eq_of_map`),
      the thirty `rfl` clause reductions above them, and the length facts. **No fuel bound appears
      anywhere**: a shortfall can only answer `false`, so an answer of `true` at *any* fuel forces the
      shape — which is why this is the cheap half and the other is not. Falsified by mutation rather than
      argued: reversing the positional walk's element comparison breaks the family's `change` on the
      clause *and* breaks `fuel_saturation`. **The completeness direction landed the same day** — a
      `pathPar` pattern matches itself — as a six-member family in the same file, the mirror of
      `fuel_saturation` at the same depth-indexed bounds, so the row is closed by `spatialMatches_iff_eq`.
      Two things it cost, both worth keeping: the members must be stated at **their own fuel**
      (`… fuel …` with `bX ≤ fuel`), not at `fuel + 1`, or every inter-member call is off by one; and the
      bound's arithmetic needs `parNodes_pos` in scope explicitly (`omega` cannot see that a `Par`
      presents at least one node) *and* the goal's `bCore`/`bList` unfolded, since neither is a
      `[simp]`-tagged definition. Falsified by mutation: dropping the set guard's length condition breaks
      that family's `if_pos` step, the thirty reductions, and the guard's own ratchets. One trap, worth
      keeping: the family's members are `private`, so only
      `spatialMatches_imp_eq` is citable from the register — a row naming `eq_of_core` would fail the
      reference check" },

      the obstacle was a modelling gap rather than an induction: the rule's constructors built their \
      receive through `receiveParP`/`receiveParPs`, which *fix* `freeCount := patterns.length` and \
      `bindCount := 1`, so the rule could not derive what the search accepted — the port's `free_count` is \

      the node fires one when every bound channel holds a matching datum, and this model's rule fires only \
      on a single-bind receive — the search agrees with the model, so a fully matched join is a step in \

      the three ledgers, the two parameters), the gate (`isBoundary`, `divisor = max(epochLength, 1)`), \
      and the four steps in `close_block`'s order (`epochStep` = commit → move → pay → reselect), with \

      than a restatement of a branch. What the row's statement names is now proved: a bond pools the \

      activates it **with the stakes it selects** (`a_boundary_activates_the_pool`, a statement about \
      the selected pairs rather than a set of ids since AUDIT C92's model change), and **an epoch \
      conserves** — every transfer is a \
      vault-to-vault move, so user vaults + staking vault + Coop vault are invariant \
      (`epochStep_conserves`, from `payDue_conserves` plus the observation that the other three steps \
      are ledger steps). **The refusal is structural, not a hypothesis**: `payDue` is partial \
      (`Option`) and returns `none` when the vault cannot cover the payout, because the port's \
      `debit_pos_vault` *fails* the transfer (`native_state.rs:debit_pos_vault`, its refusal inside `debit_pos_vault`) and \
      `close_block` (`native_state.rs:close_block`) writes nothing on that path — the debit's `?` inside it \
      returns before any of its state writes — an unguarded `Nat` subtraction would truncate the debit and mint the \
      difference, which is the quiet-wrong-answer shape this project refuses everywhere else. Two \
      falsifications, both run: deleting the payout's vault debit makes `payDue_conserves` unprovable, \
      and weakening the guard (`≤` to always-pay) does the same — the second is the one that shows the \
      guard is what keeps the theorem true. The earlier note, kept for the record: \
      not `close_block`'s four steps or the gate over them, so the statement above is a claim about the \
      Rust, evidenced by those tests and anchored here. What is worth formalizing is not the gate \
      itself (`if boundary then … else s` restates its own definition, which is the `vacuous` shape) \
      but the **conservation** an epoch preserves: the staking vault plus the Coop vault plus every user \
      vault is invariant, which is what makes a payout a transfer rather than a mint. That is this \
      row's Programme C item. **The absence rule's third form, and what it cost (2026-10-02, #150).** \
      It was first a filter over a per-validator record in native state (`pos:last_spoke`), read out of \
      the boundary block's **pre-state** — which is a function of the proposer's justification set, and \
      nothing requires a block to justify everything it has seen, so the penalty could be *aimed* at a \
      chosen rival. It also measured the wrong event: an attestation block carries no system deploys and \
      so recorded nothing, while an attestation *is* a message. It now reads a participation map derived \
      from the **last finalised fringe**, which is what the epoch seed reads and for the same reason, and \
      the record it replaced is **retired** — leaf, codecs, op, proto field (reserved) and variant, with \
      the block-level system-deploy list losing an entry. **Two things that cost are stated here rather \
      than left to the diff**: retiring the entry shifts every positional seed in that list down by one, \
      which is a consensus change of the same class as an insertion; and a block written before the \
      retirement is refused at **replay** rather than at the wire, because an unknown proto oneof field \
      decodes to `Empty` and `replay_block_system_deploy` is what rejects an `Empty` entry in a block's \
      system-deploy list. The read's residual is the seed's own: the steering space is \"one per \
      reachable fringe\", so a stale fringe moves every validator's reading back together and singles \

      deploy's effects are therefore absent from the merged state because they are never read: a fact \
      about a `for` loop, whose theorem would be one that cannot fail — and the rule this register \
      applies to its own models (G6's, and C95's) is that a statement holding by construction is a \
      statement nothing can falsify. So the first half is recorded rather than modelled, and what is \
      left is the second, which is a **design decision and not a gap. And it is a question shared with \
      the Scala, not a port divergence.** RCHIP-02 is a \
      proposal: `MergeScope.scala:87` defaults `rejectionCost` to `DeployChainIndex.deployChainCost`, \
      and `DeployChainIndex.scala:73` defines that as `deploysWithCost.map(_.cost).sum` — the same \
      objective this port's `merging.rs` computes over the same set. Nothing in either tree refunds a \
      denied deploy, and `docs/src/node/block-merge.md`'s open-items list has said so since the merge \
      work landed. **What Programme B changed about it**: before the staking vault existed the \
      deployer's phlo was *burned*, so 'the validator is not rewarded' was true for want of any \
      reward; now the phlo is in the pot and the epoch distributes it to the active set (laws 45/46), \
      so the RCHIP's second half has become false in a new way, indirectly and at epoch granularity — \
      and the port's epoch rewards have no per-deploy counterpart in which 'the validator is not \
      rewarded *for this deploy*' could even be stated. Closing it means choosing an objective and a \
      refund path that the Scala does not have, which is a consensus change without an oracle; the \
      decision taken is to leave it open *with the reason*, in the row and in the doc, rather than to \
      implement a proposal and call it a port" },

      bounded frames, an AST of depth `n` — so `d` levels of `c` operators compose into an AST of \
      depth `d × c` with both guards satisfied. Measured on the node's own 32 MiB worker: a debug \
      build **aborts the process** between AST depth 732 and 994 (a ~4 KB deploy term, SIGABRT), and a \
      release build costs **64 s** at 8,040 and aborts at 50,100 — while the deploy path runs parse \
      and normalize *before* any phlo or balance check, so that is free to the submitter. The fix is \
      `MAX_AST_DEPTH` + the walk, and this row is that fix's *quantity*; the agreement between the two \
      is `walkPar_iff_parDepth`, in `Rchain/Depth.lean`'s 23-member `mutual` theorem block — the \
      recipe this row names, `Rchain/FreeVars.lean`'s, and the block carries **no `termination_by` \
      and no `decreasing_by`**. \
      **Why it took three attempts, and the correction** (2026-09-28): this file's own note had blamed \
      `termination_by`. `Rchain/FreeVars.lean` falsifies that — its definitions carry it and its 23 \
      theorems sit in a block without it. The variable was where the extra `Nat` sits: `FreeVars` \
      takes the recursed term first with the level as a plain pattern variable, while the walk as \
      first committed matched the budget *in the equation header*, which routes the definition through \
      a well-founded fixpoint whose equations the theorems must then be proved about. The reshape is \
      the row's own recipe applied correctly. Dropping `termination_by` was never the fix, and the \
      attempt that dropped it paid in `Decidable`. \
      **What this row does not claim.** `rholang/src/parser.rs::exceeds_ast_depth` walks the surface \
      `Proc`; its own doc comment calls its count \"a proxy — and a deliberate one\", because the `Par` \
      \"adds a small constant per construct\". So `walkPar_iff_parDepth` is an agreement *inside the \
      model*, and the bridge to the parser's tree is a modelling argument rather than a theorem. \
      **One of the consumers this clause's statement names is not bounded by this constant, and is \
      handled rather than bounded** (2026-09-26, AUDIT C101): the *evaluator*'s frames are larger than \
      the normalizer's — a parsed flat chain as send data (inside both parser guards) returned `Ok` at \
      300 and 320 links and **aborted the process** at 350, below this bound — and the fix is that a \
      left-nested operator chain is now evaluated **iteratively**, so its length costs no stack and no \
      second constant is needed. So the sentence above holds for the normalizer, the sorter, \
      `well_scoped`, the matcher and the printer *by this bound*, and for the evaluator *by \
      construction*; lowering this constant instead would have refused every chain of 257..512 links \
      the chain guard admits" },

      C100). A contract folding its accumulator into a deeper pair reaches depth `n` in `O(n)` reduce \
      steps, inside `DEFAULT_MAX_REDUCE_STEPS`; on the node's 32 MiB worker in a debug build a fold to \
      depth 101 costs 7.3 s of CPU and a fold to depth 401 **aborts the process** \
      (`thread 'tokio-rt-worker' has overflowed its stack`, SIGABRT) inside `eval_single_expr`'s \
      recursion over the value. So the bound sits below that abort, at 256, and *apart from* clause \
      a's 768 — the two walks have different frames (the parser route's overspill is ~1,000, the value \
      route's is ~401), and sharing one number would be a bound that does not fire before the crash it \
      exists to prevent, which is what this unit's first draft shipped. Depth counts *nesting*, not \
      length: a flat list of any size is depth 2, and it is the accumulator-nesting shape — which no \
      contract needs — that this refuses. \
      **What the guard covers, and the residues it does not.** It sits at \
      `rholang/src/storage.rs::ChargingRSpace::check_value_depth`, called by **both** produce paths, so \
      it bounds the values the space holds and therefore every later reader of them. Four routes \
      remain unguarded and are named rather than implied away: a produce's *channel*, a consume's \
      channels/patterns, a continuation's body, and state restored from persistence at boot. It also \
      does not bound the **evaluator's** recursion while building the value, because the guard runs \
      after that walk — the honest statement of the mechanism is that the deepest value ever built is \
      capped at the bound + 1 (iteration `i` evaluates depth `i` and produces depth `i + 1`). \
      **The accounting the owed statement got wrong, and what replaced it** (2026-09-28): this row \
      said the Rust walk gives an `Expr` node **no level of its own** while `parDepth` counts it, and \
      that the gap is therefore a slack bounded by `MAX_PARSE_DEPTH` (128) because \"no runtime path \
      builds `Expr` nodes\". Every clause of that is false. The walk gives **no element node** a level \
      — `push_value_fields` pushes its fields at the depth it was handed, as do `push_value_expr` and \
      `push_value_connective`, so `Send`/`Receive`/`New`/`Match`/`Bundle`/`MatchCase`/`Connective` \
      are transparent along with `Expr` — so the counted quantity is the number of **`Par` nodes** on \
      the deepest `Par`-chain, which is `Rchain.parNestDepth` in `Rchain/ValueDepth.lean` and not \
      `parDepth` at all. And a runtime path *does* build `Expr` nodes: `(a, b)` **is** \
      `Expr::ETuple`, built by the reducer, which is the shape `rholang/tests/deep_value_bound.rs` \
      exists to exercise. The gap is a *factor*, not a constant: \
      `Rchain.parDepth_le_three_mul_parNestDepth` proves it is at most three, and three is tight — two \
      element nodes can sit between consecutive `Par`s (`Receive`→`ReceiveBind`, \
      `Match`→`MatchCase`), so a `Match` ladder spends three levels per `Par` and \
      `parDepth ≤ 2 * parNestDepth` fails from two rungs. At this bound that is `3 * 256 = 768`. \
      **Two boundaries of the tie are named rather than hidden**: the Rust guard never pushes its root \
      (its fields go on the worklist at depth 2), so it accepts a value with no `Par` child when \
      `limit = 0` where the model refuses it, and the two agree for every `limit ≥ 1` — which is what \
      `maxValueDepth` is; and the guard walks `New.injections`, which the model's `New.mk` does not \
      have, so it is *stricter* there, which is the safe direction. \
      **The gap this unit's own claim hid**: the guard's first draft sat inside `produce`, under a \
      comment calling it the one place a value enters the space; \
      `rholang/src/storage.rs::produce_at` — the scheduled path the channel scheduler and the deferred \
      block paths use — reaches RSpace directly and never passed through it, so one of two produce \
      entries was open. One shared method now, and the test fails on the old shape: with the scheduled \
      call disabled, a 257-deep datum is *stored* (`ScheduledProduce { application: None, .. }`, no \
      error) and \
      `rholang/src/storage.rs:a_value_at_the_bound_is_stored_and_one_past_it_is_refused_on_both_produce_paths` \
      reports it. **The ordering between the two bounds is structural rather than asserted**: \
      `MAX_VALUE_DEPTH` is written as the smaller of 256 and `crate::parser::MAX_AST_DEPTH`, so a \
      parser bound \
      lowered below 256 lowers it too and the ordering cannot drift. (`min` spelled as an `if`, because it is not const-callable here.) Asserting it instead was tried \
      and refused twice, which is worth recording: a `#[test]` over two constants can never fail, and \
      the `const`-block the linter suggests in its place is a *panic site in production code*, which \
      the type-system gate counts — so the invariant is carried by the definition rather than by a \
      check. **Not closed by this clause, and filed separately**: a *parsed* term of depth \
      257..768 is still an abort route (the evaluator recurses before the guard sees the datum), and \
      nested tuples make the parser exponential — both are C-row findings of this pass, and neither is \
      a depth bound's business" },

      at the reader that needs it*. `multi_parent_casper.rs:156-165` reads by the fringe-only key, and \
      the base it would need is computed *later* (`:230-238`) as the base block's post-state else the \
      previous fringe's state — the base **is** the value that read returns, so a reader asking for a \
      fringe's state cannot name which base the record it wants was written under. The design chosen \
