# The ρ-calculus base sort over the flat `Par`

The node executes the reflective higher-order **ρ-calculus**: a single grammar in which a *name* is a
quoted process (`@Proc`) and a *process* can dereference a name (`*Name`), with parallel composition
`|`, replication (`!`, carried by the `persistent` flags), `new` (fresh unforgeable names), `match`,
and the ground/arithmetic expressions. The flat `Par` ADT in `Rchain.Par` *erases* the quote/eval
distinction — a `Par` in name position *is* a name — so the reflective core is recovered in the type
layer (`Rchain.Ty`).

This module gives the ρ-calculus **structural congruence** `≡` (Law 2 core): parallel composition is
commutative/associative with identity `nilPar`, and `≡` is a congruence. This is the
`P | Q = Q | P`, `P = P | Nil`, `(P|Q)|R = P|(Q|R)` fragment of `name-equivalence.k` and
`rholangmatchingtut.md`. Deep α-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution stay Coq's obligation
(Laws 2–3, per `AGENTS.md`); here we state the congruence the type system needs and prove the
fundamentals (`Rchain.Ty`) over it.

def sendPar (chan : Par) (data : List Par) : Par :=
  Par.mk [Send.mk chan data false] [] [] [] [] [] [] []

/-- The pattern a `receivePar` binds: a **bound** variable (a de Bruijn level-0 binder), which is what
`for (x <- chan)` desugars to — it matches any datum and it is *closed*, because the receive binds it.
(A wildcard `_` would also match anything, but a wildcard is not closed in the model's `Closed`
judgement, and `Rchain/Ty.lean` proves `Closed (receivePar chan body) ↔ Closed chan ∧ Closed body` —
so the pattern has to be the bound form.) -/
def anyPat : Par := Par.mk [] [] [] [.evar (.bound 0)] [] [] [] []

/-- A receive **on channel `chan`** with body `body` (single bind, non-persistent).
`ReceiveBind`'s fields are `(patterns, source, freeCount)` — the **source is the channel** — so
`[anyPat]` in the patterns slot and `chan` in the source slot is the shape that *means* "listens on
`chan`". The previous `ReceiveBind.mk [chan] body 1` put the channel in the patterns slot and the
body in the source slot, which is invisible in a theorem that never asks where a receive listens —
and fatal to law 40, whose whole question is exactly that (AUDIT C27). -/
def receivePar (chan : Par) (body : Par) : Par :=
  Par.mk [] [Receive.mk [ReceiveBind.mk [anyPat] chan 1] body false 1] [] [] [] [] [] []

/-- Minimal reduction `⟶` (Law 4 core). COMM contracts a send/receive on the same channel to the
    receive body; reduction is a congruence under `|`. The capture-avoiding substitution of the
    sent data for the bound level — and replication (`!`/`!!` re-inserting the redex) and `new`
    freshness — are Coq's Autosubst/α-equivalence obligations (`AGENTS.md`); the redex contraction
    to the body is exactly the fact the closedness-preservation theorem in `Rchain.Ty` needs. -/
