# Laws 8 & 11 — deterministic COMM, replay determinism

A COMM event is content-addressed by the sorted produce refs (Law 8); replay recomputes COMM events and
must agree with the recorded trace (Law 11). The Scala oracle is `trace/Event.scala:35-39` +
`ReplayRSpace.scala:68-71`; the Rust realization is `rspace/src/trace/event.rs` (the event types and
their hashes) + `rspace/src/space_matcher.rs` (sorted-first selection) + `rspace/src/replay_rspace.rs`.

## What the consolidation pass changed here

This file carried four axioms: `produceRefs : Comm → List Nat`, `comm_content_addressed`,
`replayEvents : Trace → List Comm`, and `replay_comm_subset`. Two of them were claims about *undefined*
functions, so they said nothing —

* `produceRefs` is a **definition** now, mirroring `Comm::apply`'s sort (`event.rs:150-173`), and
  `comm_content_addressed` is a **theorem**: a COMM's identity is canonical because the refs are sorted,
  which is Law 1's canonicalization applied to the event log.
* `replayEvents`/`replay_comm_subset` are **deleted**, and Law 11's row went to `vacuous` with the
  reason written down. The law is real in the code — replay recomputes the log with the same matcher and
  checks membership, and it checks the *reverse* too ("Unused COMM event", `replay_rspace.rs:580-590`) —
  but in that model "recompute" and "record" would be the *same function*, so the subset claim would be
  `rfl`. What gives it content is a model of the recorded store, so that the two are different
  functions that must agree; that is the modelling step below, and it is landed.

## The modelling step, landed (2026-09-23, Programme D unit 9)

The design below is the one the previous attempt worked out and reverted two or three build cycles from
closing, with one change that removes all three of the obstructions it hit: **multiplicity is
`List.count`, not a function of our own.** The earlier version defined `occurrences` by its own
recursion, so every lemma in the proof opened with `if e = c then 1 else 0` under a quantified binder
and had to fight `if_pos`/`if_neg` reduction, variable shadowing, and `0 + x` normalisation. The
prelude's `count_cons_self`/`count_cons_of_ne`/`count_erase_self`/`count_erase_of_ne`/`count_eq_zero`
are exactly those lemmas, already proved, and `List.erase` is already `remove_bindings_for`'s step. The
proof is then `omega`-plus-`simp` and nothing else.

What the model is, and why it answers the note above: the replay's **record is an input** — an arbitrary
list of COMM refs — and the recomputation is another. They are *different* values, so the claim that
they agree can fail, which is precisely what the deleted `replayEvents`/`replay_comm_subset` could not
say. The check the port runs is the replay as a relation over those two inputs: one step per recomputed
COMM, each requiring a recorded occurrence *at that point* (the forward half — `ReplayCommNotInTrace`),
and the relation ends only when the record is empty (the reverse half — `check_replay_data`'s "Unused
COMM event"). The law is then an **equivalence**: the check holds exactly when the two inputs have the
same occurrences.

Two consequences are theorems here rather than claims, and the second is a live hazard:

* `the_forward_half_alone_admits_a_diverging_trace` and
  `the_reverse_half_alone_admits_a_phantom_recomputation` — neither half suffices, each with a witness.
* The port drops the reverse half for a **failed** deploy: `check_replay_data_with_fix`
  (`casper/src/runtime_replay.rs:587-599`) returns `Ok` on an unused-COMM failure when
  `eval_successful` is false, the RCHAIN-3505 workaround. So on that path the check *is* the forward
  half, and `the_forward_half_alone_admits_a_diverging_trace` is the witness that it admits a trace the
  strict check refuses. That is the divergence-masking the plan flagged: a play/replay difference of the
  kind this law is about can pass unremarked behind a failed deploy. Modelled as a theorem so that
  removing the workaround is a change the register can see.

/-! ## Law 11 — the replay's check, as a relation over a record and a recomputation

The record is `rig`'d from the log (`replay_rspace.rs:516-518`) and the replay walks the recomputed
COMMs against it; the two are **separate inputs** here, which is what gives the law content. The key a
recorded event is found under is `commId` — the port compares `Comm` *refs* (`Comm::apply`'s result,
`event.rs:150-173`), never the `Comm` itself, whose produce order Law 8's `comm_content_addressed` has
just shown to be non-canonical. -/

/-- The key the replay's multimap is indexed by: a COMM's canonical identity, with `Consume` written
    out as its two fields. It is a product of `List Byte`, `Byte` and `Bool` rather than a structure of
    its own for a mechanical reason worth recording: `List.count`/`List.erase` — the multiplicity the
    replay walks — need a `LawfulBEq` instance, Lean does **not** derive one for a custom structure,
    and the built-in product already has it. -/

/-- How many times a ref occurs in a trace. Multiplicity, not membership: the record can hold the same
    COMM twice, and the port's `remove_bindings_for` (`replay_rspace.rs:334`) consumes **one**
    occurrence per recomputation. An `abbrev`, so the prelude's `List.count` lemmas rewrite through it
    without every proof opening with a `simp only [occurrences]`. -/

  if a ∈ l then some (l.erase a) else none

/-- **The replay as the port runs it.** One step per recomputed COMM, in the order the replay consumes
    them: the COMM must still have a recorded occurrence (the **forward** half — `removeOne` is
    `remove_bindings_for`, and a missing occurrence is `ReplayCommNotInTrace`), and the relation ends
    only with the record **empty** (the **reverse** half — `check_replay_data`'s "Unused COMM event:
    replayData multimap has N elements left", `replay_rspace.rs:576-586`). Both halves are one relation

    are independent inputs, so this is a claim that can fail — a recomputed COMM the record does not
    have fails the forward half, and a recorded COMM the replay never consumes fails the reverse half.
    What it does *not* model is the recomputation itself: `recomputed` is an input here, and the fact
    that the node recomputes the same log is the reducer's business (law 25), not this check's. -/
