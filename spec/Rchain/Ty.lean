# The type system over the ρ-calculus (the CoC layer)

Lean 4 *is* a Calculus of Constructions (CIC); this module uses it to type the node, taking the
ρ-calculus (`Rchain.Rho`, `Rchain.Par`) as its base sort. The goal is the **totality invariant**: the
node's own code admits no silent partiality (no `unwrap`/panic); every partial operation is either
proven total on a refinement, or returns `Option`/`Except` at a declared boundary.

Two layers, both here:

1. **The language sorts** — the one real rholang type distinction: a term is used in *process*
   position or *name* position (see `rholang/reference_doc/pattern_matching/rholangmatchingtut.md`).
   `PSort`/`Ctx` give the variable-level judgment; `isPureName`/`classify` give the structural
   name-vs-process classification of a term.
2. **Well-formedness refinements** — `Closed` (no free variables, Law 6), the refinement that makes
   the interpreter's partiality impossible, together with the proof that it is preserved by
   composition (`parMerge`), structural congruence (`≡`), and canonicalization (`sortList`).

The theorems at the bottom are the **fundamentals** the specification document cites.

## Canonical order (Law 1) — the one residual assumption

`Rchain.Sort` *defines* the canonical `sortPar` and *proves* Law 1 (`sortPar_idempotent`,
`sortPar_comm`). The single remaining assumption is the **lawfulness of the structural
comparators** — that `cmpPar`/`cmpSend`/…/`cmpListParPair` form a total order, stated as the 69
`cmpX_eq_iff` / `cmpX_swap` / `cmpX_lt_trans` axioms in `Rchain.Sort`. This is the standard "the
canonical order is total" postulate (every canonicalization needs a lawful order); discharging it is
a separate, later proof obligation (the 23-function mutual induction over the flat `Par` family).
