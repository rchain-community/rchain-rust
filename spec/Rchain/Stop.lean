# Law 76 — a concluded stop stops

**Why this module exists.** The node has two places that conclude it "is stopping" — the self-reset's
failed act (`casper/src/engine/reset.rs`, whose doc says a node in that shape "must not keep serving") and
the LFS sync terminal path (`casper/src/engine/node_launch.rs`, "this node is stopping rather than serving
a chain it never synced"). Both are a `return Err` from a task **nobody joins**: the launched
`node_launch` future's error is only logged, and `NodeProgram::serve` never awaits it, so the block
receiver, the processor, the proposer and the API keep running. A logged line is not a stop.

**The law.** Once a fault the node cannot serve through is reported, the node is not serving and cannot
return to serving: the report and the stop are **one step**, and the step is the last one available. The
model is the smallest machine with that content — a latch and a serving flag — because the property is
about the *reachable set*, not about how the stop is implemented.

**The falsifier is the port's old shape.** `noteOnlyStep` is the same machine where reporting the fault
leaves the node serving — the shape the port had — and
`a_note_without_a_stop_leaves_the_node_serving` exhibits the reachable state it admits.
