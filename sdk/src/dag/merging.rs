//! DAG merge conflict-resolution logic.
//!
//! Faithful port of
//! `sdk/src/main/scala/coop/rchain/sdk/dag/merging/ConflictResolutionLogic.scala`.
//!
//! Law 17: the merge outcome is deterministic — `resolve_conflict_set` chooses the unique
//! optimal rejection (min total cost, then min size, then lexicographically smallest set),
//! independent of arrival order; mergeable (numeric) channels must stay non-negative and must
//! not overflow.
//!
//! Note on determinism: the Scala source uses `Set`/`Map` (unordered) and relies on explicit
//! `.sorted` in the hot paths. This port uses `BTreeSet`/`BTreeMap` throughout, which makes
//! iteration deterministic by construction — matching the *intent* of Law 17 and the callers
//! that already sort (`compute_greedy_non_intersecting_branches`, `add_mergeable_overflow_rejections`).
