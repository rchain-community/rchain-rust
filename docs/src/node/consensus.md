# Consensus (Casper)

The node reaches agreement on a single chain state using **CBC-Casper** — a *correct-by-construction*
family of consensus protocols. This chapter describes the software's behavior: what a block is, how
blocks relate, and when one is **finalized**.

## Blocks and justifications

A **block** is a validator's message: it bundles a set of deploys (the transactions it is proposing), a
pointer to the resulting state, and — crucially — its **justifications**: the hashes of the other
blocks the validator has seen and is building on.

Block production is **deploy-driven**: a validator proposes only when it has new work — user deploys,
slashes, or an epoch change — or when it attests (an empty block) to advance finality. An idle network
produces no blocks. (The devnet's `--autopropose` adds a periodic dummy-deploy tick on top of this, a
dev-mode convenience — see [Local devnet](devnet.md).)

A validator's **justifications** are its view of the network. Two blocks that justify each other's
predecessors are *consistent*; blocks that justify conflicting histories are in competition. The
collection of all blocks, joined by justification edges, is a **DAG** — the *block-DAG* — rather than a
single chain.

## The fringe

Casper's estimator selects, from the DAG, the **fringe**: the set of latest messages such that there is
**one message per bonded validator**, and the set forms an **antichain** (no message justifies another
in the same fringe). The fringe is the frontier of the "agreed" part of the DAG; the blocks behind it
are what every validator is effectively building on.

The fringe is monotone: as new blocks arrive, the fringe only advances — its heights never decrease,
and a message's **seen set** (everything it transitively justifies) only grows. This **monotonicity**
(Law 15) is what prevents the estimator from "flipping" its choice of a history.

## Finality: > 2/3 bonded stake

A block becomes **finalized** when a **supermajority** of the bonded stake has attested to it. The
threshold is *strictly more than two thirds*:

```
isSuperMajority(stake, total)  =  3 · stake  >  2 · total
```

The comparison is done in exact integer arithmetic — never in floating point — so the `2/3` boundary is
precise for stakes of any size (Law 14). A finalized block can never be reverted: no set of validators
holding at most one third of the stake can out-vote it.

Concretely, the finalizer (`Finalizer` in the DAG layer) tracks the **support** each block has from
the bonded validators, and advances the finalized fringe whenever that support crosses `> 2/3`.

## Block validity (Laws 16–17)

Before a block is added to the DAG, the node validates it:

- **Block number** is `max(parent numbers) + 1`; a validator's **sequence number** strictly increases by
  one per block (no reuse, no gaps).
- **Content addressing**: the block's hash is `Blake2b256` of the block *minus* its hash and signature —
  so the hash determines the block body, and any tampering changes the hash.
- **Bonds cache** equals the proof-of-stake state: the stake a block carries must match the stake the
  chain has actually bonded.
- **Merge determinism**: when a validator merges concurrent deploys, the result is a unique, min-cost
  selection; numeric channels are non-negative and never overflow.

These checks are what make the DAG self-consistent — a node rejects any block whose claimed view
doesn't match the real one.

## Why correctness-by-construction matters

A blockchain's consensus only works if every node computes the *same* next state from the *same*
inputs. CBC-Casper is "correct by construction" in the sense that its safety — no two finalizations of
conflicting histories — is a property of the protocol's *structure* (the `> 2/3` threshold and the
fringe's monotonicity), not of a particular implementation. The rholang layer underneath provides the
matching determinism (the canonical order of Law 1, the deterministic COMM of Law 4), so the whole
stack — from a deploy to a finalized block — is deterministic end to end.
