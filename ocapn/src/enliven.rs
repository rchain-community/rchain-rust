//! The sturdyref enlivener: the object that turns a sturdyref back into a live reference.
//!
//! The conformance suite fetches it by swiss number (`fixtures::STURDYREF_ENLIVENER`), delivers it a
//! sturdyref, and expects the implementation to **dial the peer that sturdyref names and fetch the
//! object there** — which is what makes a sturdyref a capability rather than a name, and what breaks
//! the "a `fetch` of a peer I am not connected to does nothing" shape a vat would otherwise have.
//!
//! It is also the *dial-out* case the node did not have: `Session::dial` existed and was called from
//! no production code, and nothing owned a second session's loop. This object does, through
//! [`SessionHandle`]/[`SessionLoop`], and it registers every session it opens in the
//! [`SessionRegistry`] so the crossed-hello rule can see it.
//!
//! **What it answers with.** The object it fetched lives on the session it just made, so the answer
//! is a [`Forward`] — an object that routes deliveries back to that session. A peer on the original
//! session therefore holds a live reference to something it never had a session with, which is the
//! enlivening the suite is testing.
