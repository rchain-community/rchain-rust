#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! OCapN for RNode — the object-capability network (`https://ocapn.org/`), CapTP over a pluggable
//! netlayer.
//!
//! This is the transport that lets an Agoric vat hold a live reference to an RChain object and
//! invoke it, and vice versa. It is Layer 2 of the cross-shard design record
//! ([`docs/src/node/shard-invoke.md`](../../docs/src/node/shard-invoke.md)): the delegation layer
//! built over Layer 1's primitive, *a cross-shard call is a caller-signed deploy*.
//!
//! **The implementation guide is built, not a stage of it** (the design record is
//! `docs/src/node/ocapn.md`): the Syrup codec and the locators (`syrup`, `locator`, `peer`); the
//! netlayer trait with the `tcp-testing-only` and `unix` transports ([`multi`] dispatches a dial by
//! the locator's transport name); `op:start-session`; the import/export and answer tables with
//! `op:deliver`, `op:listen`, pipeline answers and GC; third-party handoffs and the sturdyref
//! enlivener; and the bridge — a delivery to a chain-backed export becomes a signed deploy.
//!
//! Nothing here is on-chain by itself: sessions, wire bytes, and answer bookkeeping are node-local
//! state. What reaches consensus is only the signed deploy the bridge produces.
