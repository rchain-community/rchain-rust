//! The merge's **block index**, built against a live runtime (`casper/src/merging.rs`).
//!
//! `BlockIndex::get_block_index` and the `apply` constructors under it read the mergeable-channel
//! sidecar and the block's **pre-state**, so they cannot be pinned from the pure fixtures the file's
//! own test module uses — the classification table in `spec/TEST-COVERAGE.md` called this whole path
//! `harness-bound`, and named the fixture it would need. This is that fixture: the same
//! `common::build_runtime_manager()` the determinism tests use, a block produced by `compute_state`,
//! and the **first** lookup of a block — whose sidecar has never been persisted. That last detail is
//! not incidental: it is exactly the state an LFS-restored or deep-replayed block arrives in, and it
//! is the arm where the index regenerates the sidecar by replaying the block rather than failing.
//!
//! The random seed is derived **from the block** (`BlockRandomSeed`), not chosen by the test, because
//! the regenerate arm replays the block with that same derivation: a test that picked its own seed
//! would produce a block whose replay computes a different state, which is a fixture bug that would
//! look like a merge bug.

///
/// **What it took to get there is the useful part, because the first two shapes were wrong and their
/// failures looked like the defect.** The merge refuses two accepted writers of one native key that have
/// not seen each other, and every block's cost accounting writes the **staking vault** — so a bare pair
/// of siblings both write it, one chain is rejected, and `reject_whole_blocks` takes that block's
/// **whole** native write set with it, the slash included. That is what the first shapes measured: not a
/// lost write, but a conflict the fixture had given the merge no way to order. **Tell it that the
/// slashing branch has seen the other and the victim is gone**, which is the shape a merge over a chain
/// with an order has.
///
/// **AUDIT C207 removed the need for that workaround, and the fixture now runs as the bare pair.**
/// Cost accounting is composed per accepted deploy instead of travelling in the block's sidecar, so the
/// two siblings conflict on nothing and the merge reconciles them the way it reconciles any two
/// branches. The `ancestry` map is empty on purpose and the test is a falsifier for the fix: restore the
/// old shape — cost accounting back in the sidecar — and the pair conflicts again, one block is
/// rejected whole, and the slash is gone from the merged root.
///
/// The single-branch control is kept because it is what made the two-branch failure legible: without it,
/// a failure says only "something about this merge is wrong" rather than "the merge can fold this branch
/// and something *else* is dropping it".
