//! **A deploy's native-state write must be readable through the block path** — written as the
//! falsifier for AUDIT C205 / issue #203.
//!
//! **It passes, and that is the result, not a disappointment.** The test was written to be red on the
//! tree that has the defect; it is green, which eliminates the layer it exercises. The in-process
//! block path — `RuntimeManager::compute_state`, which is the proposer's own entry point — puts a
//! user deploy's native write into the post-state the block commits to. So the loss is **above** this
//! layer, in the node's pipeline, and no future investigation should start by re-reading this code.
//!
//! What survives as value here is that elimination, kept as a regression guard: whatever the fix turns
//! out to be, it must not make *this* stop holding.
//!
//! The live measurement that stands in for a red version of it is in
//! `spec/audit/evidence/n203-native-write-probe.md`, and it is a weaker statement than "the write is
//! lost" — see that file's correction.
