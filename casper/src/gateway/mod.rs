//! The multi-shard gateway: the on-node two-phase-commit coordinator (Laws 26–29, "Layer 2").
//!
//! The node-side realization of `docs/src/node/shard-invoke.md`'s *"a gateway peer that is a member
//! of both shards"*: a node that validates several shards can drive a cross-shard transaction
//! **itself**, submitting each leg as an ordinary signed deploy to the shard that owns it, instead
//! of relying on an off-chain client to reach both shards over the network.
//!
//! What is and is not consensus-critical:
//!
//! * the **legs** are ordinary signed deploys through the real pipeline — pooled, included in a
//!   block, executed by the `rho:txn` participant. They are never evaluated directly on the play
//!   runtime: that would mutate state outside a block and be discarded by the next proposal's
//!   merged pre-state;
//! * the **decision** (and its durable record, [`ledger`]) is coordinator-side. Law 27's
//!   all-or-nothing is supplied here — no shard's reducer does network I/O, and no other validator
//!   runs a coordinator;
//! * the **routing** — which shard a leg goes to — is this node's business, not part of any shard's
//!   consensus.
