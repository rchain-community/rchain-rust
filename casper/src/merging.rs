// **Ordering, equality and hashing are one key**, and this is a correction rather than a port.
//
// The Scala kept the two apart — `Ordering.by((hostBlock, postStateHash))` beside an `equals` over
// `deploysWithCost` — and that is legal there, because a Scala `TreeMap` reads only the `Ordering`.
// Rust is not: `Ord` **must** agree with `Eq` (`a == b` iff `a.cmp(b) == Equal`), because `BTreeMap`,
// `BTreeSet` and `sort` all read the order as the identity. Kept apart they did exactly what the
// std docs say they must not: two chains of one block — same host, same post-state, different deploys
// — compared `Ordering::Equal` while `==` said they differed, so a `BTreeSet` of chains silently held
// **one** of them and a `BTreeMap` keyed on one answered `get` for the other.
//
// On the chain-level native relation (#280) that is not a lost lookup but a **hang**: the dependency
// map held one such key whose value was the other chain, so `get` returned that value for *either*
// chain, and `traverse_tree` — which has no visited set — walked the one-element cycle for ever.
// `merging::native_merge_tests::a_blocks_own_chains_are_ordered_and_dependent` is the reproduction,
// and it hung CI on #281 rather than failing it.
//
// The Scala ordering's primary pair is kept, so the relative order of chains from *different* blocks
// is unchanged; the equality key is the tie-breaker, which is what makes the order total.
